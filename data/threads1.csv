"Meh. Not the greatest experience on a Chromebook. Seems to be customized for phones only. Opens in a little screen that you can't expand or resize - for reasons that are a complete mystery to me. Judging from the fact that every other app I know of is resizeable, this seems like it was a conscious choice by the developers . Why you'd do something like this is beyond understanding and suggests a control freak approach. Not a great way to make a first impression.",negative
"Currently, it's very challenging to use. It's in dark mode and I want to change it to brighten it up. But apparently I can only change it through Instagram? Why? Dark mode needs to be improved. It's tough on the eyes and the UI is visually unbearable. Twitter nearly perfected the UI. I think it's a decent start but I can't use it for more than a couple of seconds even if I wanted to.",negative
"I still don’t want to see content from people that I don’t specifically follow unless I explicitly search for it. And when I do search, I want to see an option for complete searches and not just user searches. This is a bare-bones poor clone of Twitter that seemingly is just getting some initial traction due to political bias. No thanks - fix it. Also, if you don’t provide a web desktop option to use the service, it’s a double whammy.",negative
"Could be great if all pages loaded when you clicked on them. Sometimes they just don't. Posts usually don't load at all. And my biggest thing: if you follow someone on Threads, you automatically follow them on Instagram as well. Either they're two separate apps or they're not. I would really like to be able to have a different list of people I follow on each app.",negative
"Not bad! This is its first launch. There is still room for improvements... I would like to see a trending page, longer videos, and an edit button for any threads(posts) uploaded by the user. Improve the loading time. Add a pause button(and slow motion controls for videos). A quality selection on videos(1080p, 720p, 480p, etc).",positive
"Over all, the UI of this app is good. Using it is easy and visually it is very clean. Unfortunately, it fails in the functionality department. My home feed is 99% random people and not the accounts I actually follow which defeats the purpose of following someone in the first place. I recommend having the home feed be just the posts from people I follow and a separate discover/search page that will show new accounts who post similar content to those I follow.",negative
"Pointless in following anyone. The feed algo won't show you the content you actually follow and want to see. I find myself opening this app wanting to like it but quickly get annoyed by seeing randomness. It's like you're invited to a party all your friends are at. Then you get there and it's nothing but strangers all trying to have incoherent, disjointed conversations with you at the same time. It's more stressful and annoying than engaging.",negative
"Not quite ready for prime time. Needs a feed specifically for accounts you follow. If you have more than one Instagram account, Threads doesn't allow easy switching between accounts without involving logging out/logging in/security confirmation. This shouldn't need to be repeated over and over. Also, it is concerning that the app is blocked in the EU due to privacy violations. Use at your own risk.",negative
"Very frustrating experience. Feed it's full of users I don't follow and don't care for their content. Switching between my company and private accounts forces you to complete sign out and reverify. Picture upload quality is compressed, Twitter images are much sharper. I am hopeful for this app, but it should have never been released as a finished product in it's current state.",negative
"It needs a lot of work. It constantly crashes, to the point where I can barely use it. It isn't auto-following everyone I follow on insta. I can't search for terms, which lead me to a topic I'm interested in and the layout feels quite lacking. It needs some sort of visual flare: animations, pops of colour, page transitions, etc... just something to make it all feel pleasing and tie it into a great package.",negative
"I find the UI does not clearly separate the messages and particularly which messages are part of a conversation. I have also found the app gets stuck updating and randomly crashes. It would also be useful if when I block someone, they are also muted rather then having to select both. I have had to remove a lot of people and companies I don't want in my timeline.",negative
"Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface.",positive
"It's not bad so far. A handful of unsolicited requests, but they're easy to despatch of. Clean feel and just seems nice and neat around the edges. It's like a flowing conversation. As a moderate social media user, it does everything I need it to for the type of app it is. Some sound and freezing issues with some videos I have viewed, though I am sure they'll iron these things out over the next couple of months",positive
"Constant crashing when trying to upload most photos, although there doesn't seem to be a pattern of image size or resolution, which causes it to crash or simply fail to upload. I have, however, been able to upload images up to 44MP, 33MB successfully uploaded. Would like the option to clear the random rubbish from my feed without having to keep muting them!",negative
"Very easy to use because it's just like Twitter. But I'm starting to hate it because Instagram's best traits are being removed. Reactions for chats, and music for stories? Might as well just remove this app threads. Instagram is being loved through posting pictures but it is very convenient for having conversations with reactions if you don't know what to say. Music for stories is also important to express oneself. I just hope the effect on the Instagram app is just temporary.",negative
"As soon as I opened the app, it went good, the login and all, but as soon as it loaded, I could not even use this app because it started acting so weird, like a bug or smth. All pages are overlapping on each other, I can't even interact with anything because as soon I do, the page starts to behave like a bug. Even reinstalling didn't help fix this issue",negative
"Great App! Loved it from the very first day although I have the following challenges; 1. My keyboard does not stack with the UI page, it covers it and so I can't see what I'm typing. 2. Can't save images like every other user. 3. From 100+, Can't see the latest follower as an individual to see their profile; have to search. 4. UI gets a little confusing sometimes as there's no proper demarcation between one thread on my timeline and another. 5. Opening some threads crashes the app occasionally.",positive
"It suddenly closes. I thought I just accidentally hit my home button but no. I was typing but overtime, it suddenly closes. There was even no draft of the text I was composing. Happened multiple times. I just updated this app and thought that it would fix the issue, but no. This is also the reason why I stopped using this the last time, I got frustrated because it kept refreshing(?) or closing and the thread I was composing is not even saved.",negative
"This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform.",negative
"It's addicting but feels cramped and messy because there are unnecessary elements like showing the profiles in replies, but it depicts friendliness, so it's good. And I feel like the elements are too close to each other. The app is great because there is no ads, spam, and free from toxic, yet. I hope they can keep the environment safe and toxic free.",positive
"I don't normally write reviews but I'm so annoyed with this app! I've tried to share a picture about 10 times, both by sharing from my gallery and directly uploading to the app and it's not working. I've tried updating the app and when that didn't work, uninstalling and reinstalling. I'm at a loss. Very frustrating.",negative
"There's an annoying glitch that makes this app almost useless, whenever I change tab, such as from activity to feed or profile, their UI overlays on top of each other which makes reading anything is Impossible. I had to minimize and reopen the app in order to make the glitch gone, but only temporarily because the same issue will reappear if I try to change tab again. Please fix this!",negative
"The application doesn't work and constantly says 'Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again'. This is frustrating. I tried to clean cache and data, reinstall, different internet and wifi connections, with and without vpn, but nothing works. I truly want to use it, but I can't. :( Fix it, please.",negative
The lack of options when it come to seeing unwanted content you are not following is annoying. If I like certain things the app will bombard me with a bunch of similar content that I'm really not interested in. I try with this app but it got more and more frustrated as I keep on using it. I really wish there was an option to block certain things in my timeline not just in replies.,negative
"Missing most basic yet most-desired features like saving media! It's intended to replace Twitter but lacks a simple save function for images and videos. People like to SHARE and people like to SAVE media. Every single person on the planet knows and understands this. It cannot and will NEVER replace Twitter as long as it is missing a feature everyone wants, period.",negative
"Yes, the app is excellent. My experience with this app has been fantastic. I know it's a new challenge for Twitter. Here are my suggestions for the next update: 1. I highly recommend adding a scheduling feature. This would be incredibly useful for creators like me to plan and schedule their Threads in advance. 2. Another suggestion is to incorporate a direct messaging (DM) feature. This would enable users to have private conversations within the app.",positive
Really needs a lot of improvement. It's a promising app. Hope you can fix the bugs. Add options to filter what we want to see in our home page. Add DM. Option to add more than one account just like in IG. It's frustrating to go back and forth. Oh well... Hope this app will improve.,negative
"Very messy to use, filled with threads from irrelevant people, despite the data collection that meta has on all their apps which include health and fitness for some reason. This makes it extremely boring to use, as the algorithm doesn't appear to be able to show any of my interests that it has collected from instagram - seeing as the two apps share the same account. It would be better as part of the instagram app, such as reels, as a section inside there.",negative
"Update: Threads cannot handle dark mode, and it is automatic. so after 9 p.m. it is impossible to use, at least on Android 9 ------- more than half the time, threads shows a garbled mess of letters on an Android phone. also, threads has no means to report this it sure would be nice if they had some sort of feature to send a picture and show them what it looks like, or simply have a way to message or report an app issue",negative
"There's a glitch in the app. Pages are overlapping. Tries every possible aspect to resolve the issue by re-installing, clearing cache & data but still unable to use the application properly. Very disappointing. Finally, uninstalled the application as for now. Whenever the app will improve, will download it again. Till then using that old Twitter.",negative
"The data collection on this app is SINISTER. The user agreement has the same function as Facebook where they literally own your images and content, and can use it commercially. Now I can't delete it without deleting my instagram! If you are an artist, avoid this app at all costs. Everyone else, go into your phone data alloance settings and turn off all data allowances for the app. It won't stop the data mining but it might help. Very dangerous for user security.",negative
"The first day on the app has been really good- I haven't noticed any bad bugs or experienced any crashes. Please add a following-only feed and an option to view in chronological order. That would make the app so much better. Pretty please 🙏 Since this is competing with a certain bird app, a trending page with current events/etc would be really nice and appreciated!",positive
"I was excited for the app but once it is loaded, I could not even use this app because it started acting weird. All pages are overlapping each other. I can't even interact with anything because as soon as I do, the page starts to behave like a bug. I tried to reinstall but it didn't fix the issue.",negative
"This version would be decent if we were talking about a beta, but it is the final version and it lacks many QoL improvements. There is no option to see only the threads of people you follow in chronological order, can't use hashtags, the algorithm doesn't take into account the profiles you follow or interact with and recommends anything, cannot perform keyword searches, some videos don't play audio, and many more bugs and non-existing options that should have been there in the first place.",negative
"Slow, glitchy, and constant crashes! Whenever we try to post something it always ends up in the limbo, garbage experience! Update: no basic features even after month of launching, and glitches and slowness is still same, can't upload anything because it ends up in the limbo, no wonder why this app is losing the game against twitter.",negative
"Very buggy, initially after getting it, it took over 60 hours before any content showed whatsoever on my feed, despite me following many people and my partner having loads on her feed. Recently, it took me about 48 hours to upload something on it while Instagram and other apps worked perfectly fine. Multiple attempts occurred both on wifi and on mobile data with no results. It'd be really cool if the bugs could get sprayed down some more, maybe get Daxter on it.",negative
"Such a frustrating buggy experience. Looks promising for us photographers. No apparent restrictions on image size, crop or quality. But I cannot get it to load from within the app or share from my Pixel 7 folders. Weirdly it has just allowed me to post one image from my White border app. 🤷 Of the thousands of images I have to share it literally will only let me share this one image. Plus I experimented with sharing it again but the app refused and just closes. 🤦",negative
"Well I installed the app out of curiosity and it seems interesting but whenever I open the app, it's all glitch. I'm unable to see a single word perfectly and everything is just messed up on screen. Hope you resolve such bugs and issues soon and be able to provide a great user experience.",negative
"Its just not working. It was fine for a while but something happened and now whenever I try to check my notifications or write something, it says ""sorry something went wrong"". Tried reinstalling, didn't help, it's simply just broken. I was already disappointed in this half-baked trash that lacks even the most basic functions like hashtags, but at my current state, I'm unable to do anything but refresh the timeline which is filled with unfunny meme accounts and verified scum. Unusable. Zuck lost.",negative
"Just got the app, tried three times to make a post, and it failed each time. Tried different formats, low character counts, etc. and all in perfect service. It just failed to post. Maybe I'll come back when the app is actually usable.",negative
Starting was good like login and editing the bio. But after that when I opened the app to see what type of features and contents it contain. It started glitching and always it acts weird. Didn't expected this type of bad work from Meta. The application needs a lot of development. Looks like it's a launch without trial. Very disappoint. Want to delete my Threads a/c but for that Instagram a/c also will be deleted because thats the algo. Dissatisfied and Disappointed.,negative
"As a starter this is okay but there are two deal breakers. One is the feed. You get stuff from accounts you don't follow and have no interest in and it cannot be changed. Second, if you log in with instagram, you can't change anything or deactivate profile on threads as it's synced. You have to change or just delete your entire instagram profile.",negative
"I think it's a decent start. Some features I think would be important going forward, though; the ability to search topics and tags rather than just people. To go along with this, the ability to follow specific topics would do much for the ability to curate a homepage. Also, having an in-app direct messaging system would do much to improve the experience. Other than that, and the fact that this app is still in its infancy, I can see a good potential for Threads as a platform.",positive
"The app is going well and nice, easy to use, and friendly. But I recommend a delete, edit,and save option. A Delete option to be able to clean the activity or notification. To be able to edit a message or picture to add a caption when it's already posted, and a save and bookmark option. I personally need the delete option, I can't help but get anxiety when my activity is messy. I tried checking a post notification of an activist, but it swarmed up my activity history. Please add options.",positive
"It's a good app. You can share anything, especially your current thoughts and whatnots. However, I suggest that there should be a choice of interests too so that the contents on home will be filtered with that interest. It will be much more fun to use it if people see what they actually like to see. Hoping for the improvement of algorithms.",positive
Not a bad app (it runs smoothly and interfaces well with Instagram) but definitely could be improved. The home page is flooded with completely untailored posts that have nothing to do with any of the accounts I follow. Without tags it is hard to find new accounts to follow based on what I am interest unless the keyword is in their username.,negative
"Right now, it's a void. Very little of what you actually want to see shows up, and the rest is noise from bigger accounts (verified army) and ads. We'll see what it becomes eventually (your following does creep through every now and then, but not nearly enough). I do think the UI is clean though.",negative
"App crashes constantly when uploading photos. And the image picker is so basic - can't even pick photos by choosing different folders. Sigh! I hope this gets improved. Other than that, this app has been great so far to browse. I really want to like this app, just fix the posting experience please.",negative
"(Notably I am the 1st person to REVIEW this app in English). Apperantly it's USELESS APP... it has Good dark interface, but there are numerous issues 👉 it crashes often without error message, too slow to even update profile section, Can't even upload single image (despite there is with high speed broadband connection), copy paste doesn't work .. ""@"" function (in bio) doesn't work .. not sure if all these issues will get resolved. Otherwise I am going to uninstall it and stop using for forever.",negative
"While I do think the app has some potential, there are several problems. Some of them include the lack of photo filters when you upload photos, the inability to delete your Threads account without your Instagram account, the inability to use more than one account, and the app crashing several times when I log out, leading myself to delete data and cache rather frequently. I wish this app wasn't released prematurely and that Instagram gives more time to develop Threads as a more stable app.",negative
"Signed up for my other account via Instagram. Spent time setting up. Tried to post 3 times but every time I pressed the 'post' button after writing the post & adding images - it closed! Not impressed. Only using as I need to be across all social media but really not happy with my user experience on the first day of it going live, & don't like you have to tie it to the Instagram. I'd prefer it to be a standalone platform, it feels like you're being forced to put all your eggs in the Meta basket!",negative
"It's pretty much Facebook's version of Twitter. Unfortunately the app is unstable and lacks basic features find in its parents app, like switching accounts. Whenever I open ""threads"" (replies to a post within the app) the app will crash every other time. It's quite embarrassing to have the main feature bugged. The app is an unoriginal idea and it needs significant improvements. If it worked, could sort feed, switch accounts, and post audio, I'd give 4⭐ I'm using Oxygen OS 13.1 (OnePlus 10 Pro)",negative
"This app's fatal flaw is it's feed. Almost everytime I go on Threads, my feed is entirely made up of random people I do not follow and do not care about meaning I'll turn off the app almost immediately. This entire app would be saved by splitting the tabs into a following and a discovery one. Right now, it's not worth it.",negative
"Terrible in terms of privacy and lacking many essential features, such as a timeline for just those you follow. By using this (and other Meta apps too) you are giving away basically almost everything about you to a company with a horrible track record when it comes to properly handling user data. Try Mastodon instead, it's onboarding process has really improved recently and it has far more features.",negative
"So, immediate problems: The way to choose files is unsortable and awful. Writing replies to ANY post is frustrating because the keyboard will cover it. Curating your feed is difficult at best and impossible at worst, since at first it only shows verified account's posts— except you literally can't search for topics you enjoy to interact with those and curate your algorithm. I really hope it gets better.",negative
"I wrote down words and tried to correct for wrong spelling or error in words. After I pressed delete or backwards button, I could no longer write any more words. I had to discard the current thread and tried to write a new thread. In the new one, the error was gone until I pressed delete text button. FYI, It happened in Andriod mobile app when I first wanted to post a new thread. I want you to fix this bug very soon.",negative
"Worthless so far. I have no idea what the feed is doing. It's not showing me any of the accounts that I follow, and the rare one I do see the post is 20 hours old. There's no way to sort by suggested, followed, most recent, personal lists, anything. There's no hashtags, no way to really search for the content I want to follow. Hurry up and get on adding more features to make this thing functional.",negative
"With a multitude of auto-playing videos right off the fly of the homepage, it's really difficult to focus on the ""Threads"" that're meant to be the defining feature of this platform. This is basically just Instagram, but with a higher character limit. The unnecessarily large size followed by the lack of data saving features makes this app pretty redundant considering the existence of Twitter.",negative
"Impossible to use. It gets loaded with pics and text layered on each other infinite number of times and my whole screen turns into a mess. Guess it is not optimized or something. This is the only app that gives me such an issue, and Instagram itself works fine.",negative
"The app looks promising and at its initial stage that's why there are some complicated parts of it but I do suggest some features such as, messaging feature just like in Instagram; photo cropping and editing feature when posting a picture; circles would also be good; and lastly, ability to look at someone's profile picture. Overall, the app was nice and already makes some people an online friends within just few days of launch",positive
"So far I like it! It's very basic and I'm kinda disappointed at the lack of accessibility options such as being able to add alt text but... Overall it has a nostalgic vibe like when social media used to be fun, at least it is for me. Interested to see how it progresses.",positive
I've seen a lot of people had the same experience as me. But I'm gonna repeat it so someday it can be fixed. I CAN'T USE IT. Anytime i decide to simply scroll the screen the app explodes into clones of all the things on screen and nothing is visible anymore. PLEASE. LISTEN TO US.,negative
Should've launched a stable version. Full of bugs and glitches. Characters overlapping each other while scrolling through making it impossible to figure out. Thorough inspection required. Issues to be fixed at the earliest. Re-installation was futile.,negative
"Off to a great start! This is a great alternative to other text-based social media! After installing I could import my Instagram profile pic, bio and followed accounts (some of whom are already on the new app). Timeline updates are fast and videos appear to be better quality than similar platforms. My only suggestion is I would like to see a more compact timeline UI or the ability to customize the size of posts so I can read more Threads per screen 😀",positive
"Surprisingly really nice. Not going to lie. But the image and video quality is so bad. Like the compression is so so so terrible. If that was changed and we could have better video and image quality it would be so much better <33 please add that lol otherwise its actually really nice. Also having a ""following only"" browse feature would be so cool too 👍👍 new feature req. Being able to switch between mult accs!!",positive
"REALLY impressed!! WHAT I LIKED: so far i haven't experienced any bugs and the app feels very sorted, refined, thoroughly planned and well put together, i might increase my rating when they add some new interesting features, which im sure they will WHAT I DIDNT LIKE: The algorithm, its very random, i actually just want information from people i follow, or maybe a seperate for you page like on Instagram could work too, lacks some features but given the release time, I'll wait gor some.",positive
"1)When I like something, nothing happens, tye command isn't taken (2)Not smooth at all (3)The colours are dead, make it more interesting and wholesome (4)When I try to Reload a page by swiping down, the symbol keeps on doing the reloading animations over and over again, but the page doesn't change (5) Having trouble using more than one account, like insta. If the option is not there to use multiple accounts, this app is dead",negative
"Can't get through the setup process. I want to manually select who of my Insta followers to follow in Threads, and twice now I've spent a fair while going through the list only to have it shut down when I get to the end before I can continue to the next stage. It reverts back to the start, and I have to redo my profile and select everyone again only for the same thing to happen. I don't have time for this.",negative
"Won't like me sign up. Can't create an account, get stuck after inserting the code that's sent, just won't go forward. Utterly pointless. Update: After hours of trying I've given up. Constantly getting error messages & the runaround. Clearly still work to be done on this platform. So l'm going back to Twitter. Threads is useless. #twitter",negative
"Bugs still not fixed and it has been a while now since launch. Pasting attempt, it highlights the first section when attempting to paste at end of message. New line half way through message creates a new thread in a thread. Large images still probably crash the phone. Cannot have feed for just followers. Hashtags don't do anything e.g. don't change colour, not searchable. Etc etc. Happy to update rating once fixed. S23Ultra 1Tb.",negative
"has lots of potential! people are complaining that its missing aome basic features, which it is. but they were mostly focusing on making sure the app runs smoothly, which it does. has almost completely replaced taitter for me already and with some good quality of life upgrades it can be much better than twitter",positive
"So far, so good. I like the layout and ease of use. And that any follower from IG that uses it automatically follows you. Choosing which image I want to post could be better. Instead of showing me ALL my photos, let me pick the folder to look it up. That's really my only complaint",positive
"Worse than twitter in nearly every respect. When the hype dies down, everyone will be back on twitter in a week. Also keeps crashing every time when I click replies now. You have to create an Instagram account to sign up as well. Edit: also keeps crashing when I try and make a thread. At least it has quite a smooth interface (carbon copy of twitter though).",negative
"Not a bad app, could use a couple extra features. The ability to not see re-threads (turn off retweets), ability to download photos, and If you really want to pass up Twitter, Let us edit our posts after they've been posted... Maybe add a ""Close friends"" sorting option as well like with Instagram.",positive
"A good first step but many bugs still needing to be fixed. The most egregious is that the on screen keyboard overlays the input area so you can't see what you're typing. Since this is what I would consider a major bug, I'm rating this app accordingly.",negative
"Hello, I'm facing some problems with the theme of Threads. I was hoping to use a dark mode, but unfortunately, my phone's system lacks that option. Therefore, I kindly request if it would be possible for you to enhance the theme, considering that many others might also be experiencing similar difficulties, especially those who prefer a dark mode. I hope this feedback reaches you and serves as inspiration to address this matter. Thank you.",negative
Migration was supposed to be the great thing. I had to go find most of the people I follow. Notifications don't work even though they are turned on to the people I want to hear from. This is a rushed app. Not original. Feels like a partially completed term paper. Not impressed,negative
"I can't post anything. It always just says ""failed to upload"". I've tried everything, updating everything, posting short things, restarting my phone, different networks and mobile, uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times and reporting the issues and no success or response. So it's basically unusabyfor me.",negative
"Great app!!! However, I am experiencing bugs from time to time that limits my usage of the app. 😔 Sometimes my timeline won't refresh, sometimes it displays that I haven't posted threads yet even though I have, and I can't browse my notification bar because they cannot be clicked and are grouped together. I'll try to uninstall and install again, maybe that way I'll have a better experience when using the app. It has a big potential!!",positive
"The app interface is bugged. I can't even read anything because when I scroll it, the interface becomes a mess. It's like the frames of the scrolling animation are getting stacked on top of each other making it impossible to distinguish anything.",negative
"Good start, needs some key features. It auto populates your feed based on what it thinks you'd like, as opposed to who you follow. There also needs to be more filters, so you can really tailor your experience. But so far, it's clean, fun, and like early social media. Please don't let it be spoiled by ads, businesses, etc.",positive
"Pointless. It's a Twitter lite without any of the fun. Heavy handed moderation and no searches or hashtags. It lacks any useful features and the content will be gone soon if they don't quickly release features and lighten up on their policies. I'll probably uninstall it in a week, not worth the extra battery drain and Facebook tracking in its current state.",negative
"The idea of the app is fun. It feels like a safe space where people are sharing thoughts and ideas. There are a few bugs, sit crashes often and it has slowed down IG as well. But it's a new app. I'm not expecting perfection yet since it was only launched a week ago.",positive
The app is still new and I have installed the app for the first time. The setup was easy to do. One thing that I would love to see on the app is that you can upload videos on Threads and the other thing is that you can delete your profile and data because I have read that the only way to delete the data is to delete your Instagram account which I don't like because it's going to upset people when they want to delete their threads data.,positive
"Excellent. The UI was clean and the navigations were easy. There was few minor bugs encountered. The app was stable and the experience was seamless. Very easy to reach out to connections and people. Very similar its competitor, twitter.",positive
"Won't like me sign up. Can't create an account, get stuck after inserting the code that's sent, just won't go forward. Utterly pointless. Update: After hours of trying I've given up. Constantly getting error messages & the runaround. Clearly still work to be done on this platform. So I'm going back to Twitter. Threads is useless.",negative
A Twitter clone that is in internal closed alpha stage. The app sucks big time. Lacks on features and polish. Recommender algorithm straight up sucks. It almost feels like non existent. I guess it wasnt something meta invested in wholeheartedly. Also the biggest bummer is the Instagram mindset of the users. People can't be forced to morph into the forum like UX it provides. Absolutely no reason to switch from Twitter or Mastodon. Also no data transparency.,negative
"Its cool but here are some issues i see. First off you have no hashtags, you cant search topics, no dm feature, you cant add a backdrop picture. First week you could share a link and the thumbnail would show. Today it only show the link in preview and then minimizes to just the link when posted....something people are less likely to click on. Some people are not dealing with that issue. Cant claim you have an app that will allow more EXSPOSURE and things like that are missing or glitching out.",negative
"The fact that you can't make your dash chronological is bad enough, but the fact that there's absolutely no way to only see content from people you've chosen to follow? Ew. I don't want to see boring celebrity thoughts that are boosted just cuz they're ~verified~, I want to see my friends' art. Hoping you make some updates so I can give this one a better review later, but for how it is now I most likely won't end up using it.",negative
"I just wish this app had translation capabilities. 😪 I follow some very successful and super nice people from Japan and South Korea. I'm trying to learn how to read both languages, but translation capabilities would make it a little easier.",negative
"While it is similar to Twitter, it is not exactly the same. Threads has a lot to offer and at the same time a little too much. I don't require the threads of people I don't follow and also has some security issues like it is possible to upload explicit images publicly and offensively criticising the threads but at the same time it diversified our opinions. It can be added as an extension to insta, which can make it more user friendly and if used appropriately it is a great app opportunity",negative
Update fixes this issue🖤 - Good. Not Great I really can't believe in order to change my profile picture as a verified user I have to do it via Instagram and even when I do it from there it does not change. It is said that I need to subscribe and give ID in order for me to have a display picture. Kind dumb and unfair,positive
"Absolutely great. For a first version this has been good so far. Keep it up, having just abandoned Twitter,this is a solid 'alternative'. The first version is stable,reliable and I've not run into any sort of questionable buggy issues. Keep it up! I love it,and I explored most situations relating to UI etc within the app. Truly ,keep it up META & IG",positive
"It has potential. First of all the scrolling feels really sticky. Second, the search function doesn't let you search for threads only usernames. Lastly, similar to Instagram, there is no way to change the main feed's settings to only show posts from people you follow.",negative
"The application is really good but it still needs some amendments like; 1) Smoothness: the app is somewhat slow when scrolling to the top feeds. 2) Ability to save: as usual, not everyone would like to screenshot something that he/she is supposed to save. 3) Ability to change name and tag. Way to go Meta. 4) Ability to translate from one language to another. 5) Videos don't have sounds in the owner's profile. 6) When commenting on a picture, you can't see what you are trying.",positive
"I was really enjoying Threads until today, yes it definitely needs work with the feed and following but over time that will improve I'm sure. However, as of an hour ago, everytime I try to reply to a thread, it crashes as soon as I type the first letter? Hope you fix this ASAP! I really don't want to go back to Twitter! 😭 Update! Started working again after I posted this review! 🤣 Fingers crossed it keeps that way ☺ Further update! Same stupid crashing issue when trying to reply, grrr 😡",negative
"I have major issues logging in, whenever I switch it Instagram I instantly get logged out saying that the user might have changed the password when the password remains the same. The same thing happens when I open the threads app. Has a lot of potential otherwise. The app continuously keeps crashing as well as Instagram",negative
"It's look like duplicate of Twitter application, but I believe you have to work on image click bug. Whenever we are clicking on any image then instead of zooming like in Twitter image is getting little bit up and down (like vibration). So just amend some parameters in image click it will improve your application.",negative
"This is a pretty easy to use platform with a well made app. I dislike having to make an Instagram account to join Threads, but I did it anyways. Also, there seems to be a bug with the search function because it sometimes shows no results.",positive
"I enjoy this app. The UI is clean, easy to navigate, and smooth, although it definitely needs a few more features for it to really compete. It would be nice to show only accounts you follow or create a ""For You"" page that shows you posts that relate to your interests.",positive
"""Sorry, something went wrong."" I've deleted the cache, reinstalled the app, reset my connection; nothing's worked. Shame. I like the app, unfortunately I have not been able to use it for over a week. Cannot do anything besides scroll the timeline because I keep getting the error.",negative
It probably would be a good app if it actually works. When I open it it glitches as soon as I scroll leaving all the posts I've scrolled past in the background. Even when I change tabs to look at my profile it remains. Uninstalling and reinstalling does nothing to solve the issue. Unusable app.,negative
"Well, lemme admit that it has such a good ui, & ux as well... although the real challenge for now is the algorithm, its random rn, obviously its new... but i hope it'll be improved in next versions. The design team did such a great work. We would love to have a quick demo of design system published on Figma, or Instagram design. Best of luck.",positive
"So far so good. I know a new app will take multiple updated to implement all the changes needed, so I will give it time to let us choose folders and albums we want to post media from. Otherwise, it's a really easy to use app.",positive
"It's alright for now,but let's see how it goes after the perfect algorithm kicks in and some features added. Would love it if u can seperate each tweet/ thread more clearly cuz it feels a bit""compact"" and not ""comfy"" and better search too. Looking forward to how it goes.",positive
"There are no reviews yet? Anyways, it's down on my end right now. Few suggestions: explore and trending (or ""threadsetters"") tab, edit button, likes and media tab, ability to save photos and videos, user generated alt text on photos, tagging users on photos/videos, cover photo, location tagging, and zooming/viewing of profile photos",positive
"Cannot save pictures & crashes posting pics! Twitter allows you to save any picture; Threads blocks downloads. On Twitter, I can easily post a picture; Threads crashes if I try to post a picture. Ridiculous! So far, this has been a pretty miserable app! I hope they fix it soon.",negative
It's good but has a few kinks. It needs settings like an in-app dark mode instead of it being tied to my phones settings. Along with features like direct messaging. Ads don't seem too intrusive but I'd like to see more in my feed from people I follow,positive
"No Dark mode, by far the biggest crime No way to create an account inside the app, you have to have an already existing account No desktop version, for an app like this to thrive it gotta have that Upon logging in you are stuck in an infinite loading loop on the main page, only once you close and open the app again does it properly load The attach icon could be moved to the side instead of under the reply so I don't need to scroll each time I wanna attach a photo Fix this ASAP, till then have 1",negative
"Threads has definitely grown on me, the algorithm has also gotten drastically better for me which helps a lot. It's only little problems I have with the app now. Wish there was an option to hide reposts from people I follow. Really wish we could pinch and zoom on images; and wish videos would unmute when opened. Otherwise, this is a tremendous first release. It seems to accomplish the goal of Twitter's For You page well and in a way that is enjoyable to use.",positive
"The Thread app is a fantastic tool for staying organized and connected with your friends, family, and colleagues. With its sleek and intuitive interface, it provides a seamless messaging experience that keeps conversations focused and clutter-free. One of the standout features of the Thread app is its unique threading system. It allows you to create separate threads within a conversation, making it easy",positive
"The app as a platform is great, besides the interface and stuff... but one only issue is that scrolling is low smooth plus I would like to suggest some ways to make Threads go incredibly stylish, such as the like button animation and the app's icon color matching for android 13+ However it's an excellent app that's looking to be perfect, thank you Marks crew 👌",positive
"I dont know what happened but as soon as I log in into threads, its kind of a bug or something, my screen suddenly starts acting weird and the title and post begins to flicker. I reinstalled it many times but didn't worked. I can't even read a thing.",negative
"This feels like a beta version of an app. Was rolled out way too soon with the hopes of cashing in on the temporary Twitter rate limit issue. The app is a mess right now - no following tab, no way to turn off reposts from followers, no search button for topics, TL not in chronological order, no way to save pictures, no GIFs, no DMs, no Trending topics. Will never replace Twitter if these issues aren't fixed.",negative
"I understand it just released, but there's a lot to improve. Some things I think should be fixed/added: the option to search for tags or words; too many accounts I don't follow on my tl; chat system; stories; show the quotes for threads; allow us to select from gallery folders when selecting pics to post Edit: new issue, the app keeps closing whenever I try to post something",negative
Can't post 50mp photos in the app. The app crashes upon upload to a thread. But the standard sized photos seem to work fine. Would love to see more discovery options like using hashtags etc. I'm sure more things are in the works. The app works pretty fluid on my S23U. Nice!,positive
"Great app, but I think 2 issues have to be fixed,, First, it's gonna be better if the pictures/photos are downloadable, Second, when writing using 2 languages like Arabic & English in one thread, the order of the text gets messed up, so for a socialmedia where writing threads is the thing, I believe fixing this issue is necessary. Overall, creating this platform and this app is a great idea.",positive
I've only been using it for a day but so far so good. Feedback: the ability to save photos and post/reply with gifs. There's also no option to go through my folders in my gallery so when I pull up my gallery it's just all my photos and no way to access the different folders. The ability to sort the feed from either top or latest,positive
"The application works fine without problems, but there is a very noticeable minus there is no transfer in Threads, and you need to make two buttons, the first recommendation, the second on which you are subscribed, this is my personal opinion, otherwise 4 stars, I hope the developers will notice this, and by the way, me too programmer",positive
"Where to start! As highly anticipated app and I'm glad this feature were to exist as part of Instagram but as soon I'm finished with getting started I'm met with all screen bug (flashing, misplaced repeated jittered clones of everything everywhere) I'd wish I could send an internal feedback on it with attachments but can't due to bugs. // device info: Android version: Android 9 (FuntouchOS_9.1) Software version: PD1930CF_EX_A_1.18.0",negative
Overall I love the app. However.... I have not been able to follow new people or follow back any of my new followers for over 3 days now and I can not get anyone to help with this issue. Ive even tried to become verified but guess what can't do that either. This is very very frustrating!!!!! 3 stars because of this issue could be 5 if someone from support could help me out.** 5 days now so I'm going to start dropping the stars.,negative
"No interaction with people you follow. Period. You'll be lucky to see a post that isn't a business or verified account. No rhyme or reason to posts that the feed shows you. This is the same as the ad riddle Instagram platform but worse at this point in time. If you could filter by only people you follow, MAYBE this would salvageable. But as it is now this isn't worth using over Instagram or any other service. There's little to no functionality and it's not even close to chronological.",negative
"App with Limited Login Options I recently tried out an app that caught my interest due to its promising features and positive reviews. However, my experience quickly turned sour when I realized that the app did not allow login with a Google ID. This limitation significantly hindered my ability to conveniently access the app and affected my overall user experience. One of the main advantages of using Google login is the convenience it offers. With just a few taps, I can seamlessly access.",negative
"Overall, the app is good. Its performance is great for it being initial release. A few suggestions: -Ability to only see followed accounts on timeline -Trending page -Cover photo -Dark mode Pros: -My system font works on this app, while it doesn't work on other similar apps.",positive
"App keeps crashing and is effecting my Instagram (it keeps crashing) when I delete Thread my Instagram works fine. But when I download Thread again both my apps glitches. Thread prevents me from mentioning anyone, the app closes and if I'm typing a long Thread the app will close. There is a bug in the system. Need an update ASAP.",negative
"This thing is joyless. It has the basic functions of insta but with words. No way to control what you see on you dashboard, or even order things chronologically. I will see one or two posts from people I follow before there's an endless stream of influencer and celebrity thoughts that I don't follow or care about. I tried it for a day and will not be using it again unless there are major changes and way more memes.",negative
"it's on a good start to be a good socmed app, i just have some problems with it: 1. there is only a for you page, you have to see what the algorithm wants you to see and there's no way to only see posts from accounts you follow. 2. it could he more clear with the data it's taking. simply saying ""other data"" when explaining what data meta takes from us is not transparent. 3. the search section sucks, there is no trending page, no hashtags, and you can only search for accounts",negative
"It functions almost exactly like Instagram except worse in the way that your feed is literally no one you follow, just a bunch of suggested people. There seems to be little to no option to toggle that, which at *least* IG does. Also come up with a more fun and silly name for resharing posts the way ""retweet"" exists? ""Reposting"" is a completely different concept. Like the right-click save + reupload kind. That would add like a modicum of personality, at least :/",negative
"UPDATE: App works perfectly fine since the update. ORIGINAL REVIEW: The app runs fine, but I can't check out my account's Following list, as well as other accounts Following lists either to follow accounts I recognize from other platforms (the same Following list error/glitch has been happening on Instagram, too). Hopefully this error/glitch will be addressed soon in a future app update.",positive
"Doesn't work at all. I'm unable to check notifications nor my profile (""Sorry, something went wrong."" error). I also can't post anything (""Your thread failed to upload."" error). Additionally threads in feed are displayed randomly, threads from people i follow are almost impossible to spot in between so spammy, unrelated content.",negative
I am facing an issue with this application. Whenever I am trying to reply or quote a video the application shuts off by itself and that video disappears. It's happening from the day one that I had downloaded threads. Please fix that problem. Thank you.,negative
"there's no point in following user profiles because their content can't be seen on my homepage. instead my homepage is drowning in an ocean of junk content that the app has decided i should want to view, but that i don't care for at ALL. i can't even find threads using the search bar, only profiles. and following a profile is nearly useless anyway because their content is NOWHERE to be seen on my homescreen",negative
"This app definitely has potential but I have one giant problem. It glitches insanely where if I scroll, the text and photos get dragged along with it. I dunno how to explain it, but I posted a screenshot of my experience with it on dammit.bekah though I think it's just a me problem.",negative
"The app is very messy, there's a strange effect where I see every post as an afterimage, smeared across the screen. I look forward to seeing what the app is like, after the issue is resolved",negative
"This app surprisingly is a lot like Twitter minus a lot of the negative stuff. But it's clean sleek you. I really shows you how little there is to do on either platform. You can't direct message anybody, it's even hard to see what my friends are actually saying. My whole feed is a bunch of people I've never met, I don't follow, and no one's reposting it that I follow. Overall a solid experience compared to Twitter but somehow this app makes you realize how boring it is.",negative
"I really love this app, but dear Devs, please help: I was in the zone with the bad internet, where I got an error saying that the feed cannot be loaded. But when I came home, the problem didn't disappear. And unfortunately, I still cannot post for some reason, see my threads and likes. I cleaned cache, reinstalled the app, checked the network access. How can I solve this?",negative
"Bakwas app! I felt hopeless, after close the app! Too much negative news poling! App is crashing while something write here, Just like, If I add paragraph, losing the words, why? Fix this. And that's not finish. We can't save photos from posts that like most! More over, Videos are voiceless! Very bad experience!!",negative
Not perfect but could be great if they begin minor improvements like hashtags and more comprehensive search. Runs really smooth and UI is clean and simple. Hopefully it doesn't get too bloated and busy like Instagram. A lot better than the cess pool that is Twitter.,positive
"The app is good, but the app is unnecessary. With a/an Facebook/Instagram/Twitter previously in use, I find minimal usage for a [new] version of the same apps. Also... you will delete your personal IG account when you delete Threads, which is not only redundant, but a directly violation of my intellectual rights, and there is no NDA, MOU/MOA, or any other contractual agreements within the terms and agreements, prior to you logging in, and/or your account being pre-setup by the [app], itself.",positive
"I realize the app is in its infancy, but this thing is really inconvenient. I can only use the app from my phone to post. I can't use it on my laptop at all, not even taking something from my Instagram page and crossposting. Please fix this. Allow us to post from devices other than just phones. I have failing eyesight and this becomes a real problem for me because my phone screen (and anything I write using it) is so small.",negative
"Meh, I'm on the fence about it. I know it's new but it has a bunch of things that needs fixing. The timeline, if that's what it's called, needs to show stuff from who I follow, not everyone. I'll check the replies for those comments. Need a dark mode option and ability to make fonts BIGGER and maybe a bold option as well. Also a definite need is when you open the app or refresh the thread, don't go all the way to the top. Keep the thread where I left off, thanks.",negative
"Glad to be on board and excited to use the app, but on Android, we can only access our ""gallery"" and not photos from individual folders, which means I can't find any of the photos I want to share. Attempting to share multiple photos from the ""photos"" app results in the app crashing.",negative
"Missing a bunch of things I would like (some of which they eventually plan to add). Since it is still in its infant phase there are some bugs and hiccups that need to be fixed such as the homepage glitching out while reloading, lack of order in which posts will arrive on the feed etc.",positive
This is likely the most overhyped program in the history of forever. The news feed desperately needs filters and there's just not a lot of organization or structure to it. It's basically just a reformatted version of Facebook.,negative
"An excellent start to a new social network! The app runs smoothly on my Pixel, it hasn't crashed once for me. Yes, this Meta app collects data, but if you already have Facebook and Instagram installed on your phone, adding Threads doesn't make a difference. Love the interface, it's clean and easy on the eyes.",positive
It's ok but it's missing a lot of features and some of the things it has already is pretty buggy. I can't get videos to play with sound on. Either you watch with no sound or it freezes immediately.,negative
There are way too many random people on my timeline. The algorithm is terrible because they don't even appear on my Instagram. They are not related to anything I interact with. I'd prefer it if the default tab were to be for mutuals only.,negative
"So far a smooth interface, but these are to be worked on; a) App has no dark theme, it bugs when you try linking with Instagram settings. b) To be more interactive, users should read quotes. c) You can't save/download media. d) Having a trend table would widen the public discourse. e) The profile page looks bland, a header should be added, then a face lift. f) When typing, my keboard covers my text. I can't see what I type. g) a DM feature should be added. h) App settings made independent.",negative
"Super buggy, attachments crash the app any time I try one as a reply, or if it was a screenshot in my gallery, or if it's a large image. Also my keyboard pops up and covers what I'm typing so I can't see typos. Super unpolished app.",negative
There's some features missing at the moment which is understandable and I look forward to future updates but there's a huge issue for me on this app. I try upload more than one photo it crashes and refuses to open for a few minutes hopefu this can be fixed,positive
"I haven't run into many issues, mostly because I'm not much of a poster so I'm not adding photos and everything else, BUT the past couple of days my feed is full of accounts I don't follow. Sometimes it's because someone I follow commented or rethreaded it, but that's not usually the case anymore. I use the app to keep up with and engage with the people I actually follow, not everyone else",negative
"It is good. It feels fun and addictive in some way. However, I feel that Twitter was better because it had tags and we could browse current events and news. These features unfortunately don't exist in Threads. I hope that tags and searching for news or specific topics would be added to the app.",negative
"I am giving it a two star because I appreciate what you'll are trying to give us,but I wished that there could be more functions available in it. Like a translation option it will help us because some of the thing in it are from a different language so to understand that we need a translation option. I look forward for more development in this application and wish that you won't ignore this review and look into the matter deeply.",negative
"Update: i tried to reinstall the app to find that they changed the system and prevent us from sign up with email and that we have to use the Instagram account !!! If i want to make account aside from insta why forceing me to not to do it ? I tried to sign up but in the last step when you have to agree to the policy i tap agree but my process end their, everything was good till this step , agree just start reload than nothing happened and than tap again and the same",negative
"There is no need to build and launch this app. However, if zuke wasted a lot of money in copy paste work. The app is useless. It crashes, features doesn't work, @ is not working, design is not very user-friendly, and why it is connected to Instagram?",negative
"User experience is very good compared to Twitter, but some features are missing, for example I can't on my profile people I m following, and I also can't see others following list, hope this feature will arrive soon, and the logo of the app is not looking professional. Hope they don't add promoted content too much, like Twitter.",negative
"So far, so good. It's still in the early stages, and more features are being created as it's used, but so far, the experience has been great, and the community is supportive, positive, and helpful. There seems to be a concerted effort on the new users to block disinformation, hate speech, racism, and focus on sharing facts and real news.",positive
"Needs a TON of work, but I will hold out hope. There is no real search. No GIF keyboard. Some glaring bugs. Definitely released early, but with that in mind, it is quite smooth for what it does.",negative
"Simplified is one of the many AI tools I have tried and is my favorite so far. I appreciate the rewrite tool (it is the one I use the most). Sometimes I can't get my thoughts together, but this tool perfectly organizes and cleans up those thoughts for me. I can rely on it to provide me with a professional and clean rewrite copy which I have used to update my resume. This is just one of the few things it does other than being able to continue your writing or (pun intended) simplify it.",positive
"Good start. Missing some very useful features that are on the... bird app (and other social media platforms) like a followers/following only feed, and the UI could use some touching up, but otherwise, this is a good start for a new social media platform.",positive
"I am happy with the app so far. I wish that there were a few other features, like a favorites list or following tab so that I could switch back and forth. It is nice to be able to see people with similar interests and not be buried under bots and other hateful content. I am looking forward to future updates.",positive
"There is no option to edit typo mistakes. I can't see where to add a video. In fact, I can't see where to add or post anything! Managed it once but don't know how? My icons seem to be missing! Using tablet and tried phone! Doesn't flow for me! I'll wait until it works properly before I invest too much time with it!",negative
"I can't even use it properly. When I started to scroll or at least go to the other tabs it started to glitch and overlaps everything. Please fix this bug in the next update, I can't have the same experience like what my other friends does.",negative
"It would be great if I were able to follow back people. Their ""spam trap"" has me as a false positive. I have submitted a support ticket 3 times & replied to their Thread about the problem several times, but no response. It's beyond frustrating and I'm almost ready to delete my account. If the problem gets fixed, I'll add more stars to my rating and change my review.",negative
"It is difficult to claim this is a ""stand alone"" application, as you need an Instagram account to access it. I do not use Instagram, and will probably not make any further attempt to use Threads either. First impression is... no impression at all.",negative
"So far, so good! We need to be able to select what album we want to post a picture from. Right now, it doesn't give us that option. Also, when we reply to someone, it looks like it's all part of a thread instead of showing who we're replying to. Good start, little fixes here and there to make it work.",positive
"A terrible app that nobody needed. Nothing works here as it should. The UI is cluttered, with ads all over the pages and the reels integration is a nightmare. Talking about Privacy in context to Meta is a lost cause so I won't dwell much on that.",negative
"App feels really great community has taken it very well. But I will have to give 2 starts cus this app don't like my best photograph I took I can't upload it every single time I try to upload that particular photo and upload fails i don't know why but please fix this. And if you devs want to checkout the file that's causing problem fell free to reach out, I would love to help and have a better Twitter alternative. Anyways good work on UI and stuff👍",negative
Still very buggy and not usable. Threads disapear. Bio gets synced with IG even after correcting this a couple times. Also not happy with all the permanence of it. Want more control over the data and privacy and data ownership.,negative
"It was great at the beginning. Now, text threads are failing to post. I reinstalled the app, cleared the cache, changed the internet connection, and still have the same problem. Very disappointing",negative
"It was working perfectly until a few days ago and now I can't see anything in my activity tab, I can't post any new threads, I can't reply to any threads, I can only see the first post in a thread but none of the replies. I can still like threads and follow people and that's it. It's pretty much useless to have a social media app if I can't interact with any of my friends and followers. So disappointed. I really thought I had found a viable replacement for that trainwreck of a blue bird app.",negative
"It's just a Twitterised version of Instagram. Nothing more nothing else. And after a few weeks on its full of unwanted, unsavoury, bogus, fake-ish accounts that no one wanted and no one asked for. Since signing on all I've been doing is blocking and muting accounts. And the fact that it lacks so many features up until this day. Say what you will but I would rather stay in Twitter and Instagram.",negative
"As soon as I got logged in on the app the entire thing is an unusable glitchy mess. I can't even see my screen, it's just pixels tearing in every direction. I'm guessing it hasn't even come close to being optimized for every device yet.",negative
"Not only are serious security shortcomings prevalent, but placing ""Post"" & other interactive buttons at the bottom of the page means they are obscured by QWERTY & Google keypads on most smartphones. By comparison Twitter has all functions top of page.",negative
"Threads, an Instagram app is a big no-no for me. The app is glitchy, slow, and boring. It's like a bad version of Twitter that nobody asked for. Why would I want to use another app to share text updates and join public conversations when I can already do that on Instagram or Twitter? The app also makes me nervous about my privacy and security, as it may share my data with third parties without telling me. Threads, an Instagram app is not worth my time or my phone's memory.",negative
"Totally blank feed after following several top accounts. App just seems broken and doesn't do anything. No messages appear, no content. Searching for users works and following them works. But there are no feeds whatsoever after adding them.",negative
Not working! I uninstalled and installed it twice already but yet I can't upload photos. I mean I was able to the moment i installed it the first day but now just today it keeps saying failed to upload it's not a problem in my end i already do the basic troubleshooting on my phone too I restarted my phone restarted the network check other social apps aswell as yt and netflix everything is fine. Uploaded on ig & fb it's already uploaded but the one on thread it's still not since 4am,negative
"Basic features work as expected. But it's about time we get a big update with more complex features like Edit Thread, Translate Thread, Ability to pin Threads, better Feed page, video player optimization and working hastagd. A trending page would be nice too. But current app is very good. 4/5.",positive
"Why you guys don't fix it's bugs when I first time downloaded it,it's login went good and then when I scroll it things are getting overlaped, I was not able to see a word , I deleted it and downloaded it again but the same problem occurs all the time , fix it as soon as possible",negative
"I don't like that I can't edit an image before I post it. Also, when I want to post a picture, all of my gallery just spills out, no folders. It's stressful. Asides these, it's a great app Ps. Can we get dark mood🙂",negative
"The app works fine, but you can't search topics by key phrases or hashtags which means the experience feels extremely curtated and walled off. The good parts about Twitter is that it made easy to discover new people to follow based on what they said as well as find authors and artists you wouldn't have found otherwise. Threads makes so you can't really do that. You can only follow people you already know exist and can't see art by people you don't follow or such.",negative
"My review can improve over time, but it needs alot of improvement... It crashes alot and shows some annoying things on my screen. Alot of un delivered post keep appearing on my screen and it's annoying.. I wish I could share my screen so you can see it",negative
"Great version of a certain social media app. Please add the ability to switch accounts though! I have multiple Instagram accounts which I can easily switch between, therefore I have multiple Threads accounts which I would like to be able to switch between.",positive
I get severe ghosting issues from the app. It goes away when I open the task switcher then return to the app but happens again when I do anything as simple as scroll. I'm sure it's the app cause all other apps aside from this are fine. My phone is a Sony Experia XZ Premium G8141 running Android 9 Build 47.2.A.10.107,negative
"This is very alternative for the blue bird app. It's actually fun and less toxic but there's some features that are still missing 1. Following Tab, as much as I like seeing people's threads, I wanna see the one I followed. 2. Hashtags, I mean if you wanna trend something you gotta use that. 3. Trending, I'm sorry I'm so used to looking at what's the trends ATM 4. Functional Search button. Not only the person you can search but pretty much everything",positive
"I really really liked this app . I downloaded it today and at evening it's starting to get glitching like whenever I'm scrolling the texts and pics are showing multiple times . I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it but the problem is still same , please fix it I hope to get a reply 😟",positive
"The graphics are phenomenal. Please add trends based on location and a follow/unfollow button on each thread ellipse button options, and also add DMs. Otherwise, a game changer this one. Kudos to the team! PS don't sell the blue check!",positive
"its okay, hard to explore new content, there is no explore page yet. hard to find trending content/current content. the app is very bare bones at the moment but it does what it needs to. i would like to see trending content/ news content, and a way to explore new content without scrolling past new posts from accounts i currently follow on the home page",positive
I guess it's too early for this app to be released cuz it has a lot of issues and missing important features like: - the design is so random literally copy of Instagram with some Twitter things - profile page is so boring it doesn't even have header - how the heck there is no dark theme?? - ain't no way this app doesn't have direct messages - not even hashtags - the setting option are so little - too slow to share post or delete it - no gifs - recommending random people post not interested to,negative
"Publicity highly misleading. Should be a stand-alone app but instead it's only available tied to your Instagram account. If it WERE stand-alone, I would most probably use it - the world needs an alternative to Twitter... AND to Instagram (even though they're both Meta). Uninstalled.",negative
"The app so far looks good, but the one issue I have is that when I try to upload a photo, the app crashes. There are a lot features that the app needs at the moment that people mentioned (also a web version would good since I'm at my computer a lot), but it feels rushed.",positive
The app is glitching very much due to heavy amount of traffic. The written articles and captions are penetrating all over the tabs and screen. Couldn't perform specific tasks so please fix these issues as soon as possible.,negative
"First Impression of the app is good, but it would been better if there was a multi account login feature like in Insta and if it was connected with Insta with a user name instead of showing a number in the profile. And it will be better there will be option to like in Insta, by double taping.",positive
"There are many issues, first I can't edit my profile, it gives me error when pressing done button, second link to insta is not that great as pressing cancel on following on threads unfollowed people on insta, third I selected only few acc to follow from insta instead of every one on insta, but it's showing everyone following on insta as following on threads!",negative
"The posts in here are the most mundane, vapid junk I've ever seen. It seriously feels as if AI is making all the posts. On top of that there's no way to refresh the main (and only!!) Feed with new content. You are stuck with the same feed throughout the day, which only incrementally gets new content added to it as the day goes on.",negative
"Worst experience. Trying to upload the post since yesterday, 'Thread failed to upload' message pops up every time. Really frustrating. Did all the thing like , cleared cache, OS update n all. Still pathetic experience. These kind of things wasn't expected from a Meta product.",negative
Wish I'd done more research before downloading this app. Feed is filled with posts from people I don't follow and it's impossible to find posts from people I do. Now I can't delete it or Meta will also delete my Instagram account so that's how they trap you into keeping it. Turning off all notifications on this app and just won't use it since it's junk. Wish there was an option for zero stars!,negative
Want to like it so bad but it's not good. You can't search for anything but other accounts. You can't type in any words in the search bar and find other people talking about the same thing. Not trending topics. It's only a one timeline of people that threads suggests to you and its usually a celebrity or an influencer. The app isn't good.,negative
"I got regretted when I created an account at this trash app. Also it stopped working just because I'm in the country that the app is not available. I used VPN to access and after 2-3 days, the posts stopped showing and says ""something went wrong, try again"" and I can't post as well, and even If I want to deactivate my account it says ""failed to deactivate"". What's wrong with this trashy app. There is Twitter and is enough, there is no need for creating a clone trash with same idea as Twitter.",negative
For now I give it 2 stars since the app interface just acting weirdly. Looks like the screen is gllitching all the time whenever I tried to scroll. Maybe because it's quite new app. Hopefully it got fixed soon. It's annoying to not be able to do anything.,negative
Such a waste! I don't think we need Threads. It has absolutely nothing to offer. Instagram is more than enough. It's just a weaker version of an ordinary social media app. Want to delete my account but that will instantly delete my Instagram account too. That's very bad and cheap tactics. I'm very disappointed. Shall delete my Instagram too.,negative
"Threads is a fantastic blend of Twitter's essence and Instagram's seamless connectivity. With an emphasis on clean interface, it's a convenient way to stay connected with Instagram followers. If you're an Instagram enthusiast, Threads is definitely worth exploring.",positive
"Can't post photos, app crashes every time. Tried all the workarounds found on line, no joy! It is a cluster mess to read, just random posts from random people with few of the people I am following. This needs a lot work.",negative
"I found some issues while scrolling the screen. I am using Android 9 , but when I scroll the screen it flickers or freezes on the same screen. I kindly request the Threads Team to solve this issue... Otherwise I like the app so much✔️...",negative
I cannot get this app to send notifications and I cannot get rid of Twitter until it does. Uninstalled/reinstalled. Logged out/logged in. Played with notification settings in app and in phone settings. Turned off battery optimization for app. No notifications.,negative
Features requests & bugs (so far) : - notification scrolling is very limited - only full gallery is available when looking for a file to attach - no ability to just switch accounts (you have to log out every time) - no dark mode (please for the love of my retinas!),positive
"When I set my phone to dark mode the app starts glitching as I scroll, all the content keeps collapsing on top each other and it's unreadable but it works smoothly on light mode. Apparently I'm not the only one who has this issue.",negative
"While uploading photos, it keeps getting kicked out of the app, while uploading photos, it shows that the photos are not coming in the form of files or positions, all of them come together, so many problems are faced.",negative
"Not bad app, it does have less features than twitter (like polls and desktop site), but more stuff is probably going to be added one day. I'm just happy that people can (kinda) see my threads without having to pay a subscription. Though, I have a few annoyances. Like paid verification. That's Twitter's thing. I get that it has the ID stuff but still, can you at least make it where if you have alot of followers you can get verified without the fee??",positive
It's a good app for spending some of your time without losing the track of time and waste more time like in Instagram and YouTube. It is starting so it is not perfect I think it should have reel s and all plus it should have personalized content because a lot of content I see on thread I don't even care about so they could improve this with updates. It is smooth and not laggy like Twitter with which it is competing. But privacy is a problem because meta is not good privacy,positive
"Only one account? So much for businesses being able to use it. It's 2023, you would think that this feature would be one of the first things added. Frustrating to say the least and am really not interested in trying this app anymore now that I realized that I can't have my business/fan pages on here and easily switch between them like Facebook/Instagram/YouTube/Twitter all have.",negative
"It was good at first but when I came on the app today it kept on crashing even when I cleared its cache. Please fix it. Edit: It seems like my problem has been fixed for now. As I said, the app is great, missing some features like search but other than that it's pretty good.",positive
"Looks very clumsy. Material design sucks. While trying to upload the media, unable to go to a specific folder in gallery app in Android. But works well in iOS. And no option to save images like Twitter. Why that specific option is not copied from Twitter?",negative
"I think the Threads app is not bad for a starting point, although it does tend to crash frequently in the background, but that could be attributed to its early development stage. I believe it will have impressive progress in the future.",positive
"It's a good start, but it could be better. Please fix how the bell notifications work. They don't really notify me when a person uploads. And please add hastags and a better way to see posts from people I follow. I barely see anything from people I follow. Also add a way to see reposts and a person's posts separately on their account. It looks kinda cluttered",negative
"Worst experience 😭😔, i have installed threads just now and its being really like threads 😞, the app has some bugs to be fixed. As i opened the app i the posts weren't clear and were over lapping each other, creating a mess on my screen. It needs to be fixed as early as possible.",negative
"The thread app is good app as I heard from my friends.but when I installed and opened the app,it's is something coming like it's having a bug on that.i think meta can rectify that types of errors and not only for me,i saw many of the review that they are also having some bug while opening it, hence meta want to rectify as soon as possible.",negative
"Quick, yes. I will need to be able to curate my feed at some point, but this initial flood of content is a goldmine for businesses! Threads Links from other apps (WhatsApp) don't open to the app. Rather, they open in Chrome! Loss of traffic.",positive
"The app is very interesting and I personally really like it. I hope that more new features will be added in the future. Similarly, it would be better if there was a facility to save posts and apply hashtags.I also really like the colors used for the app. Already this application has exceeded a large number of users. So, I believe that in the future this will be a very secure, reliable, indispensable application for people.",positive
"It's Good but I feel like it's going to need a little more to compete with Twitter. For example This app also needs a trending page similar to Twitter. You could also include something else that is original. I feel like it could have a little bit more to it. I know it just came out a couple days ago, but there needs to be something added if this is going to keep the hype up around the app.",positive
I like it so far. The only feature I need is the ability to select photos from different albums in my phone instead of showing all photos in reverse chronological order.,positive
"My honest review, is that how it is and the idea they have of the app is perfect, following threads and about conversation. I don't think it needs DMs, and Livestream. ITS FOR CONVERSATION AND SHARING IDEAS ONLY. EASY PEACY. Cause what's the point of adding more things, it's gonna get like twitter in the future or later on instagram. I mean, there are already apps for that, let's separate things. I do agree that it could have an option of seeing feed from everyone and another of followers.",positive
"Love the app ... One thing I would like is the volume on the videos being easier to select as on .. and once it's on for one, stays on for all until I turn it off. Also, I know they have more to come like better search features. Oh, and if I could see more of who I follow on my feed, rather than your 'suggestions' ... That would be nice 👍 If you are Threads development reading this, I'm using Android,... Oh and GIFs. I have to use an app, save them and post them rather th. The keyboard on my 📱",positive
"I'm grateful that someone has created an alternative to the mess that Twitter has become, and Threads is looking promising. It's early days yet, so I expect changes, but the App desperately needs the ability to show Threads from people I subscribe to, and in chronological order of their posts. The interface is clear-ish but definitely needs work. No ads yet! Unfortunately, I've been followed by 'Sexy Susan' who has zero followers and a risque profile pic so I think the bots are active already.",positive
"Any time I scroll it blasts me with visual bugs out the walls to the point where it is blatantly unusable. The entire screen flashes, text leaves constant flashing after images when I scroll, changing tabs leaves a massive collage of broken symbols and images.",negative
"Needs a lot of work. Most of the time I can't see threads nor notifications, I always get a something went wrong message. The scroll is too slow. No indication if someone is following you or not.",negative
"Another phenomenal socmed platform by Meta! I just downloaded this yesterday and I am already comfortable with using it. The user interface is super easy to learn and get used to. Plus, the features are superb. You can literally upload Threads in one click. Furthermore, you can also reply to other people's post with text, image, and other interactions. They're all visible in one place, unlike to the other confusing and dizzying platform called Twitter. <3 LOL",positive
"It's a great app and it's really easy to navigate but there's still a lot to be done.. Add a Message Button, Add Tags in Search, Add in settings where one can disable or enable Public Replies, that should be private. Thanks",positive
"As soon as got logged in on the app the entire thing is an unusable glitchy mess. I can't even see my screen, it's just pixels tearing in every direction. I'm guessing it hasn't even come close to being optimized for every device yet.",negative
"I would really like it more if I could curate my feed. Facebook, insta, tumblr, reddit, are all positive experiences because I am able to customize my feed experience to my interests. I don't necessarily mind seeing things I didn't intentionally follow, but it should allow me to choose. I'm also really not interested in the inanity of those with massive followings. I much prefer actual conversations with people who aren't here To Produce Content.",negative
"Honestly, it really does feel like Twitter, but less cursed. I've seen no real problems with it so far. One thing I think would be cool is instead of showing the little character at the bottom right of the screen to view our profile, it should be our profile picture. Not nitpicking, I just think that'd be a cool idea. Also being able to edit our comments and stuff would be cool as well. Still an amazing app, five stars well earned thus far.",positive
"There is no editing tools. It is not possible to select some other folders while posting images, it is fixed to Gallery. Not clear view of threads. Maybe all later will come with some price on them :)))",negative
"I genuinely like the Threads app. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of some features i feel the app needs. Trending topics should have been there from the premiere. Also DMs, even if it's a button that links us to Instagram DM to complete the conversation. The app could also use the Spaces function. Overall, Threads is amazing.",positive
"Here's my honest review: It's not a bad app, but there could be more features alike that could make the whole app more fun to use. Much like how Instagram allows you to switch accounts, maybe Threads could use the same feature. The only method to switching is by logging out currently. What I liked the most was the dark theme that it came with upon opening the app. Easy to get used to.",positive
"Evidently a rushed app to fill the gap left by twitter but it honestly does provide a better experience, if somewhat barenones. All it needs is a few feed options and that's kinda it. It shouldn't strive to do everything but instead focus in on text based content",positive
Greetings and blessings to the developer team the app is really good and the ideology is great some people might not love it but it's good. But ... I'm repeatedly facing an issue of not being able to login on insta and threads at the same time so i cannot repost my threads post on insta. This may be a bug but it's a big one and pretty much capable of irritating the user. I'd love if you fixed it.,negative
"This app is excellent... But dear Meta, I'm having problem in app whenever I just open the app it opens but when is scroll down then it's start shaking and fluctuating.. I just uninstalled and restarted my phone but this problem is still same... So Dear Meta Cooperation.. Please give some solution for this problem 🙂 and if you want proof then give me your number, email or something to send you the actual problem's screen shot",positive
The interface looks simple and easy to use. But what I really hate is all the posts from whom-I-dont-even-know show up on my home page and I don't seem to find the way to get rid of them all. This is so annoying and the home page is literally useless for me. Please fix that.,negative
"All you 1stars, give it time. It's a fresh app that isn't trying to do it all. Lead devs interact with users and have explained what's to come. It's fine if you want the X Corp app where every feature breaks on launch but much of what you want is coming - personalized TL, search, etc. Don't get me wrong Meta is sinister but they know how to build an app.",positive
"I am enjoying using threads. I only wish I could tailor the post that appear on my homescreen to be more about what I like. Also, wish I could schedule or save posts I'm making for later. Also, I think it would be cool if you could try to make some widgets to be used on the homescreen of phones. Currently not having any luck of being noticed at all on the platform. Please make it easier somehow for smaller threads users to get noticed.",positive
"App seems cool. But I would like to search topics and see more of the people I'm following. Also sometimes when I click on my following list, I get a "" Sorry Couldn't complete request, try again later"" Can you fix that.",positive
"It works fine as a twitter substitute so far, but every time I try to upload images in my replies, I keep getting error messages saying that my post failed to upload. Yes, I cleared my cache and tried again. The problem still persists.",negative
"Im here to giving feedback 1. Cant scroll down if trying to write too much, the writing even being unseen with keyboard mode on. 2. Cant double tap on words to make block on words. 3. The photo cant cropped after you insert on thread. 4. Why limitation still counting words even after threads. Thats all, fix that, ill back to twitter",negative
"I see the HUGE potential in this App. Possible areas of improvement: 1. Hashtags? Easier to follow stuff. 2. Sync to Insta account. What I mean is that if I want to post something on Insta, it can automatically post the same thing on Threads (like the insta/Facebook sync) 3. Desktop version. I post some of my insta things from my laptop. PLEASE do the same for Threads. ""Moving to Threads cause Twitter is dead.""",positive
Add a better search engine. Add hashtags. Add a better way to share from the gallery albums..instead of one picture at a time. Add ability to customize profile pages with different colors and fonts. Just a few suggestions that would really help.,negative
"Makes me sign up for an Instagram account, but doesn't give the option within the app. Then it tells me my IP address is an open proxy, tells me check their help, which has nothing about it. Like I'm jumping through hoops so they can steal all my data.",negative
"Too much bugs. Please fix some bugs first. For example, when I click the delete button for fixing the word/line, all the other words will mix/collide and create some never ever known word.",negative
"For some reason, a day after I used this app, a pop-up message says, 'You've been logged out of %1$s. The account owner may have changed the password.' It keeps popping up, and the app keeps closing. Please fix this issue.",negative
"Threads features a clean and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate. The app's design is minimalistic, placing the focus on conversations and ensuring a distraction-free experience. From the moment I started using Threads, I found it effortless to locate and engage in conversations.",positive
"I had to delete my account and delete the app and start over. After ONE DAY, 2 posts and 7 likes, IT IS FAILING TO POST AGAIN!!! No warning. Please fix this!!! I am on a Samsung tablet and for the past few days my posts and quoted posts fail to upload. I need help and sending a message to @zuck and @meta does not go through, because all my posts are failing. I deleted and reinstalled this app, to no avail. It seems I can repost only.",negative
"I wish there was an option to only see threads from people you follow (Right now it's like the ""For You"" page on Twitter when it needs the ""Following"" option), and the ability to sort chronologically! If those two things changed, this would absolutely be a 5* app&beat Twitter by a mile. Right now, it's pretty ""meh"". Lots of room for improvement though!",negative
"The app would have been cool if it was working properly and doesn't look like it glicthes. Like I can't read threads and look at photos, whenever I scroll the previous thread will be on the one I'm reading. So please fix it...",negative
"Solid day 1 experience. Only a few bugs in that the search feature stopped working once or twice and there are some features that would be nice that are coming out soon (no release date, they do have it confirmed on the list of stuff coming though).",positive
"For an app that just launched a few days ago, it's honestly pretty good!! However, there are a few things I'd like to see improved & made: hashtags, folder to save threads, draft notes.",positive
"Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface",positive
"1. Although no ads in threads, but too much algorithmic content on feed which I don't really like. 2. You have to login with your Instagram account. You cannot create new account by email or phone number. 3. Once you created threads account you cannot delete it. If you want to delete, then you have to delete your Instagram account as well because threads account is interlinked with Instagram. 4. There is nothing new UI & UX. Looks like Twitter. Almost same UI. 5. No Chat option. No Hashtag",negative
"The home page needs a huge adjustment. There's no logic to the content I'm seeing. There needs to be a way to cater what you're seeing. I only want to see the people I follow, that's why I follow them. It's a mess. Additionally, there's essentially no data privacy, so be weary. Also....you can't delete your account? What a misstep.",negative
"Yes, it's a new app. But Meta is not exactly an indie developer! There is literally no reason to be flooding us with Rando Accounts. That should have been basic functionality from Day 1. But like Instagram, seems Threads just wants to push random posts on us whether we like it or not. Until basic functions are in, I'll be sticking with Twitter.",negative
"""Something went wrong please try again"". Get this message all the time. Can't see replies, my profile and many other features. This message just pops up all the time. Also people I follow don't show up at the top of my feed. I get random recommendations at top. Back to Twitter until sorted.",negative
"If there was less random stuff on feed, it would be a lot better, or if there was some way to organize it where you have a following feed and a for you feed. There's just too much random stuff.",negative
"Its wonderful it's just needs a little bit more improvement, like multiple pictures the second time you post because I posted multiple pictures the first time and now I'm unable to post more pictures including just one but I am able to upload videos which I think is weird I am also able to make regular posts with words only",positive
"Threads is a fantastic new app that enhances the Instagram experience and revolutionizes private messaging. It seamlessly integrates with Instagram, allowing users to stay connected with their closest friends and share moments in a more intimate and personalized way. The app's interface is sleek, intuitive, and easy to navigate User Shree_Morbekar",positive
"PLEASE make it so you can separate your followers from the suggested algorithm stuff, it's so hard to find the content i ACTUALLY want to to see. this would be the first thing that should be updated/added. I don't like using it that much because of that",negative
"First and foremost, the user interface of Threads is beautifully designed and user-friendly. Navigating through the app is a breeze, with intuitive controls and a clean layout that makes it easy to find what you're looking for. The app's attention to detail in terms of aesthetics is commendable, and it truly enhances the overall user experience",positive
"All the things are quite well but where the edit button i the app? On starting the the app, it's previous refreshes remains on display. But after shaking for report, it becomes normal, no lag, no glitch.! What's the matter?",positive
"Right now. This app sucks. No hashtags, no way of searching keywords. The only thing you can search is usernames. Your feed is loaded with a bunch of stuff you don't want to see. The app has potential but they rushed the launch. I'll give them a couple weeks to add some more features but right now there is no benefit for general users.",negative
"App keeps crashing. If i scroll for a while or while writing a thread, it crashes. If i am responding to a thread which has a vertical photo/video, i cannot see what i am typing. It seems as if interns have made this app.",negative
"Search function only searches accounts, not posts or keywords. Useless. The timeline is all influencers, sports, and celebrity accounts w/ high traffic. I barely see the posts from accounts I'm following! After muting unwanted accounts my timeline has not changed in the last 12 hours and I can only continuously scroll thru the same handful of posts from yesterday. No option to view posts I've liked or bookmark things to revisit later. I know it's early days but these are critical features.",negative
Why can't my name be name (not app nickname or whatever) be different than the one on my Instagram account. I use these apps for different reasons. What's even the point of this if it's just the same stuff as Instagram? Also I want to be able to view threads in chronological order and have the app save my spot when I leave it and come back. I don't want to be a slave to your mediocre algorithm.,negative
"The potential for a good app is there, but it's not good yet. Most notably, the front page is filled almost exclusively with people you don't follow. App is literally unusable until a following-only feed is implemented.",negative
"Not bad works great on my fold 4, but when switching between the displays, it asks to restart the app. It should handel multiple screens better than this. Still, it's better than Elon's crapwitter!",positive
Very weird and bad. My feed is full of randoms who confuse me and I don't care about anything they ever want to post. Lack most basic features like DMs and requires insane amount of private data. Also needs Instagram account and can't be removed without removing both accounts.,negative
"It has a constant visual bug on my device where the app's background gets smeared with whatever content is being displayed on the foreground, and it doesn't refresh back to black. ROG 2, Android 9",negative
A very lonely app if you don't already have several instagram followers. I would also appreciate a photo album option as I have 8000 photos on my phone and can't scroll through them all. I get that it's brand new but it seems very unfinished.,negative
"Not bad for an initial launch. Looking forward to future versions, and hopefully a web interface that allows posting. Needs a lot of work, but will probably exceed Twitter's features and eventually popularity.",positive
This Applications interface is shuttering when I use to refresh the page and also it don't responded as I can expect. I thing it needs to improve their interfacen !! Yes I was very excited to use this app but it didn't work in my phone. Is it running fine with your device ?,negative
"Writing after day 1, it's about as smooth a launch as it could've hoped for. I am however having a problem where if I search for users too much (as one looking for accounts to follow will do), the search breaks and doesn't fix itself. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a rate limit. It fixed after reinstallation but only once. I hope and expect more features will be added to the app in short order, too. E.g. DMs, customized account lists, Web version. Default home feed should be different.",positive
"Threads needs a search feature for content. The search bar only searches for accounts. People should be able to use the search bar to find thread topics. If you want to see what's being said about a show or person, you should be able to search keywords to pull content related to your search. The app feels unusable without that simple feature.",negative
"There's no option to disable Reels or videos autoplay on the app. This is the major reason why I don't use Instagram, its parent app. Too many unnecessary Reels or videos will consume a lot of data. I thought this would be different from Instagram, but it's all the same. I hate the autoplay.",negative
"It's more like Facebook, in my opinion, but it doesn't allow for hashtags or topic searches. I prefer Twitter, most def. I want to delete it, but the app does not allow account deletion without also deleting my Instagram. Not happy with the app at all, really.",negative
"Sorry only two stars however gotta admit the app has huge potential but you need to do two things, first get rid of the annoying celebrities and influencers and brands that i don't follow nor any of the people on my following list interacted with from my timeline, second you need to disconnect the app from instagram or at least make the link between the two optional.",negative
"The size of the application is huge. There is also no data saving mode with it, We can't stop autoplay videos. Get the lite version of this application as soon as possible.",negative
"I like it, but the content us not sorted chronologically, so I keep seeing posts from two days ago mixed with more recent posts. Also, lots of post from corporations, celebrities and influencers keep being shown in the timeline (if we can call it like that), so I spend all my time muting and blocking, because those marketing agency contents are annoying to see.",positive
"I am a big fan of this application. I've been getting tired of all the changes Elon has done to twitter. There is still a very steep growth curve, but im very excited. There are two features that I feel like would be really helpful to improve user experience. 1) as im writing my threads, if I exceed the number of threads my screen allows, I am unable to scroll down to see what im writing as my keyboard is blocking the view, and threads doesn't allow to scroll down. 2) threads scheduler!",positive
"When I log into Threads, I automatically log out from Instagram and vice versa. There is no option to see posts only from accounts I follow. There is no option for posts that I am NOT INTERESTED in. It is new, and people like new things, but let me just say it, there is a huge need for improvement.",negative
"The amount of data this app requires from users is absurd. And the fact that you can't delete your threads account without deleting your instagram is horrible! The app itself is mainly text. If you're joining as a Twitter alternative, don't bother. You can't even search posts. There are no hashtags. I already want to delete threads just because of the extreme data mining. Europe has blocked it for those exact reasons.",negative
"Lacks a lot of features so here's some feedback: Add a trending page in there. Make it so that the followers and following can be accessed separately, like on IG. Allow people to have different usernames from their IG handles. When there's a bunch of images, show them in a collage instead of showing one big image and then scrolling to the others like in IG. Also, let people zoom into pics without the images resizing themselves automatically. Don't compress images. Make it different from IG.",negative
Draining the battery and the app is missing a lot of features. They force you to use Instagram account for using the app. If I want to delete the account for Threads then I have to delete my Instagram account too. Please read details of the app it may collect before U download because they collect too much sensitive informations like financial and health also others details. The app working poorly because it keeps crashing when trying to post or comment and login push notification keep lagging.,negative
"This app would've been a better version of Twitter but if one wants to delete the account, they need to delete their Instagram too. This is the worst implemention a company could have brought. Deactivating does not include your Instagram but still, you should be able to delete your account without deleting Instagram! At least this information needs to be in the registiration page OR the description of the app.",negative
"Great app with lots of potential. The app's social features are also fantastic. I can connect with friends who are also using Thread's, create groups, and even send direct invites to plan lunch dates. It's a great way to stay connected and coordinate lunch outings with ease.",positive
One thing this app is good and it's on time where we'll get to see latest things more than Twitter. But one thing keeps me annoyed is that whenever I'm scrolling and a video pops out I always have to unmute and next video comes I still have to unmute like I just can't stop doing that. So that's the only problem I'm facing with this app so if that's fixed by next update I'm sure I'm gonna put 5 stars on that,positive
"Everything else is OK , but When you go to gallery you have no option for going to your photo albums. If I have 500 photos in my gallery I have to scroll through every photo in my gallery to get the particular one. I think there should be an option for getting access to your photo albums in attachment.",positive
"I'm still learning why I need the app & how I can make it work for me... Haven't found my identity yet... However... Sometimes while leaving a thread of my own or commenting on someone else', I'll be randomly kicked out, as if I touched my minimize button, (which I haven't) & it's gone out of the post I was in & cleared what I typed. Most times I would loose the post completely... You can imagine how frustrating this is! 10 July, I had to re-type my own thread 4 times, as I kept being kicked out",negative
"I want my video muted for private reasons and i hope insta/meta devs can make it slightly bigger so that i avoid pressing the video when pressing the unmute button, i hate it when it happens becoz the video gets enlarge, i like the auto play feature while scrolling, the mute/unmute button is just my problem. So i rate it 4/5, so far so good it feels like a new home, a new space to breath, new people to meet, internet feels new again. Thank you Instagram! Thank you Meta!",positive
"I am not impressed. The app should have been separated from IG. Any restriction on one should never have to affect the other. Again, the whole idea of not having access to one's followers list at some point is annoying. Can we have a tab to mass-unfollow everyone who isn't following back. I need my time line to be filled with contents I choose to see from followers. It crashes a lot too.",negative
"Definitely still enjoying this low stress and low drama experience on day 2. It has room to grow and improve, and a rollout of new features will help to retain users, but for something in its infancy, it's pretty great.",positive
"I like the app, however there are some glitches and recommendations I have. For one, the reply function seems to be finicky, it on occasion force shuts down the app when I am trying to reply to a post (a thread?). Another recommendation is discoverability, I would love a tab where you can discover new people and what they're saying. Like a community or discover page, also a trending tab with news and the sorts would boost engagement.",positive
"Great app... but some things need fixing. The app crashes anytime I try to upload a photo, probably 10mb or higher. Plus, the quite disorganised feed. Asides that great app and competition for Twitter",negative
"I like the simplicity and the focus on conversation. Plus, no ads yet, which is why I gets 5 stars. There's no clear organization of threads. I like the panorama photo presentation, too, it's slick. Threads can't take credit for the quality of users, but I'm rather enjoying the pleasant and kind people I see on there.",positive
While typing out a post or reply the app force closes with no error message. And when it does this it has no temporary memory to start where you left off. Rather frusting if you plan on posting rather than scrolling,negative
Not too bad so far it feels a little barren in comparison to some other websites and apps but it has potential The quality control and filtering need some work And i'd like more control over the timeline of stuff I see but it's a start,negative
"Threads is an amazing app for staying connected with your close friends on Instagram. You can share photos, videos, messages, and stories with your chosen group of people in a fast and fun way. You can also customize your camera with shortcuts and create your own status to let your friends know what you’re up to. Threads is the best app for keeping in touch with your besties.",positive
"Threads is a useless trash app. They could have made the app completely separate from instagram, but nope. That's not complicated enough for them. I can't log into my account right now on either app.",negative
"I don't know if this is a common issue, but I can't even scroll the app. It acts like there is a crash in the app. Suddenly the screen get black and words mixed together",negative
The only thing that's keeping me from giving this app Five stars is the fact that I can't post uncompressed photos that are larger than 10mbs at a rough guess. If I try to the app crashes or fails to post the image which is really disappointing,positive
"Wow, I am absolutely blown away by the Instagram Thread app! It has revolutionized the way I communicate and share content with my friends and followers on Instagram. The app's interface is sleek, intuitive, and user-friendly, making it incredibly easy to create and manage threaded conversations. One of my favorite features of the app is the ability to organize my comments and replies into threads.",positive
"I find it quite annoying that you cant log in with your Google ID and have to instead log in/create an account with Instagram! Also changing your username or name in general... you have to do it via Instagram. I would love to try the App out, but considering that I always have separate accounts accross different Social Medias, I have to wait, until Meta decides to review this issue, in which Im apparently not the only one.",negative
"Pretty Solid App. Wish it didn't show me threads from people I don't follow, and an easier way to find people and subjects through searching. Very fun and simple to use. Surprisingly well managed and appropriate.",positive
There are many problems which I want to address. 1) No themed icon support on Android 2) you can't insert from clipboard if its an image. 3) you can't add gifs and only thing you can add is attachments and that opens gallery. 4) username can't be distinct from Instagram. I use Instagram and Twitter for different audiences so it doesn't help. 5)App doesn't support 60 fps video upload. 6) No button to jump to DM with any one.,negative
"The developers have already said that this app is a work in progress. Let's hope it gets better than Twitter and simplifies text based posts. At the current stage, the user interface is easy and beautiful. A lot of famous Twitter profiles have already moved to Threads, so it's not lonely here. The biggest issue is that you see posts from accounts that you never followed! It's very very annoying.",positive
"The app is kinda horrible when I used. When I tried to use this for an hour, it keeps crashing and stop working without any reason. It makes me feel frustrating, I hope meta can fix this problem.",negative
"This app doesn't even have good features! It just got fame due to Twitter's outage. App UI is horrible! Doesn't even have stuff to do in here. Only good thing is that it uses your Instagram ID as login and you have the option to follow all the people you followed in Instagram, that's a neat feature! APP WILL DIE WITHIN 6 MONTHS!",negative
"No windows options. Bizarre, for a text based app... typing on a keyboard is still the fastest no matter the speed of your thumbs! Also the searching... trending... aspects as documented eleswhere.",negative
"Good app, still needs more features. For a base app that only released 1-2 days ago, it is pretty good. But there is a lack of features, such as polls. Although I'm sure they'll be adding that stuff later. Overall high quality and engaging app!",positive
"Objectively better than the alternatives. It's really that simple. Mastodon was ok but everyone left. Twitter was great before it turned into a barely functional sewer fire. Can't tell you about Bluesky because it's been in closed beta since the beginning of time itself. By default, Threads is pretty good. I'd give it 5 stars if it had trending topics/tags and a desktop web app.",positive
"ive tried mutliple times where i try to reply or start a new thread with a picture, but the picture does not load and instead crashes my app and kicks me out. i can only reply/post with words. no pictures at all.. please im just trying to post art wips on threads i dont want this to mess up on me any longer😭",negative
"it's getting me frustrated. there are glitches everywhere. i have been restarting the app for several times and the glitches were still everywhere, can't even read a word because of those. kindly fix it, it's irritating.",negative
"Super, very excellent app. The only bug I noticed is when typing comments, the UI doesn't adjust for the keyboard so that you may see what you're typing.",positive
"I had high hopes for the app but unfortunately anytime I try to add a photo to my posts the whole thing just crashes. Although still very early, at launch this is a pretty discouraging bug to deal with.",negative
"I like it. But it needs improvements: 1. Please add the Options to choose pics from another folder. Its so hard to find it just to scroll down all the way. 2. Add the login option for IG lite user like me. This app is good right now especially I can post longer messages, (of course it's name is thread hehe). Good job Meta 👍🏻",positive
"Installed it thinking this time it would be different but it's way more unorganised than any other app. It's like everyone coming up, dumping on thread, need an update where we can see what we want, I don't know where our preference went, like they asked initially but it doesn't seem like they are even using it.",negative
"It's great so far! Just wish there was a few things added to it for a better experience: 1) make it easier to switch accounts without logging out first, 2) have a save / bookmark feature, 3) fine tune the feed because I'm seeing way more posts from random people I don't follow, compared with the people I do follow and want to interact with",positive
The app and all is cool interface is also aesthetic the things is everything is connected to instagram which doesn't gives the app its own personality like for example i can't select another username on the app so please kindly change this thing atleast make the app independent plus also introduce the messaging feature,positive
"It's just too random with no control over who's post pops up on feed, kills the purpose of following/unfollowing folks. In a way, it's worse than seeing ads. It'd be usable if we could limit main feed posts to only the ones who we follow and then a separate explore/Activity section.",negative
"Really pathetic app, can't even share my YouTube video link properly only link showsup and the thumbnail doesn't. I was showing up a couple days ago but now it's just the link. They should sync the facebook link debugger for threads as well.",negative
"For some reason, this app needs access to the following information from your phone: Personal info (even though you'd be providing that yourself) Financial info (excuse me, what?) Health and fitness info (Why?) Messages (Emails, sms, etc) Photos and videos (I suppose it needs access when you want to upload) Files and docs (can you upload files and documents?) Calendar events (is there a built in calendar?) App interactions, installed apps etc Web browser history (What?) Gross",negative
"I got bugs and can't use the app properly, the texts and the images starts to flow and my entire screen gets filled with the floating texts as I scroll through it. Please look into it",negative
"twitter? don't know her. charice. okay but so far, i wish there would also be a media tab and that you can glide across these tabs instead of tapping. there's also no ""pin to profile"" feature yet. and as of now, i still can't post lyrics coming from spotify (both of them should work on that). i'll give it a 4.5 out of 5 (rounded up) as i know that this will still have a room for improvements. keep it up.",positive
"So far my time on threads have been satisfactory. But this bad boy needs more features. Editing posts, saving photos posts, use of hashtags, direct messages, monetization, third party app linkage, logging without Instagram, and that's all I can say for now.",positive
So I tried getting onto the app today and it wouldn't let me and instead made me have to do an appeal with verification to prove its me. I submitted it and they just put a message saying thanks and to wait until the appeal is finished being reviewed to see whether or not I can regain access to my account. Says if they find its not me that it will be permanently disabled which is bs! Hope they fix this and let me back on my account!,negative
"After 7-8 hours, I gave up. It's a lonely place if you're arriving blind without existing Instagram followers. A default feed full of influencers I can't relate to and if it's possible to search for posted content that interests me, I can't figure it out. I'll check back in a few months when it's more mature. Uninstalling for now.",negative
Very annoying that the first time you try to confirm your mobile number you are issued with an alpha numeric code and yet can only enter numeric on your phone!!!!!!! Made me want to uninstall right away. Issue codes that actually work. Plus bcos im on hols issuing the text to my UK number in another language. Very irritating.,negative
"App keeps crashing whenever I try to upload a pic. Also, had a lot of notifications for follow requests. However, after individually accepting a couple, the rest of them disappear. :/",negative
"I love the potential of this app and can see myself use it more, but the only way that's happening is if my feed only shows me accounts I follow rather than having somewhat of an explore page on my feed. It's really content and information overload and we already have that with Instagram unfortunately - I don't think I can handle more without deleting one or the other. Please no ads or random algorithms, just a chronological feed of accounts I follow. Also surprised how hashtags don't work here?",negative
I had high hopes for this app. Unfortunately there is way too many bugs that makes the user experience poor. Threads is also lacking on lots of features that Twitter currently has. The censorship and invasive data collection is also a big downside. The marketing made me believe threads would rival Twitter but I just don't see that happening. Threads needs a big revamping in order to actually compete with Twitter.,negative
Has great potential. Just needs an option to only display feeds you follow and an option for chronological order. Those would definitely make it an amazing app.,positive
"at first I like it but I started having a problem. It keeps closing. I'm not even done composing my caption. I couldn't upload the photos that I wanted to post because it keeps on stopping. I refresh it, I log out and went online, I redownload the app but still I couldn't post what I wanted to post :<",negative
"This is very similar to the bird app, but without the rampant toxicity. It works well enough, but it does feel a bit light on features. Hopefully it will become better with time. Overall, I am really enjoying Threads.",positive
I really like it!! Though I have a suggestion that could really help a lot of us users. Please add another option for following where we could only see the threads of the person we follow. I really don't like my feed as it's really messy and too much people I don't follow. I wasn't really interested at all. Plus it's also hard to see my peeps threads because of those unnecessary threads at all.,positive
"A subpar Twitter with less features, inability to save/share photos, and already being overrun by spam bots. Like it's been up for so little time, one would think they would have pulled all the kinks for fighting spam from their instagram, but no.",negative
"Doesn't work! It says ""something went wrong"" in the app and I have tried absolutely everything to fix it but nothing seems to help. Very frustrating as i have already spent good 2 hours, uninstaling and clearing cache etc...nothing fixed it.",negative
"It's amazing that there is a new app for safe spaces and I hope this app won't be a tool for bullying and such things, cause last time that's what they did to twitter. Now I have a problem with the search bar, and I hope in the future there will be an option in which you can search for topics you like or a certain topic you wanna engaged with!! Over all it's good!",positive
"It's great, just wished it had dark mode and the ability to switch accounts without the app glitching out. I don't want to keep uninstalling to fix it.",positive
"The user interface is really amazing, smooth and lag free unlike the twitter user interface. This is really a good thing as laggy, smoothless experience can really be so annoying",positive
I like the app very much but if you think it is going to replace Twitter keep dreaming it may be in a mess right now but it is not as tuff as Facebook if you like to add certain content that is for adults that is why Twitter is not going anywhere soon plus you need to fix it so does not use a lot of battery power in the background when it is not being used,positive
"It's pretty ok so far. If it gets better in later updates I MIGHT move from Twitter. Off the top of my head a few improvements you can make is adding a timeline for accounts you follow & let us make other customizable timelines, adding post search would be amazing. Normally I don't like Meta/Facebook products but honestly? As an artist I just want to get out of Twitter and still have a chance getting seen.",positive
"Past few days, if I try to share a link to an article, instead of it looking like it should, with a preview image & headline, all that shows up is a truncated URL.",negative
"To best honest Threads is fat better than other social media . I didn't notice anything wrong there but one thing I've noticed that there is a same problem like Elon's Twitter , after posting anything we can't edit that & it was so much disappointing for me . When i was opening the account i thought there should be available that feature bt Alas! So you should add that feature.",positive
"Meh. With nothing explicit really allowed, it's just Instagram with a more text-based UI. What's the point if it's just Instagram with a different look? Also, a translate feature would be nice.",negative
"It has a lot of potential, I feel that its missing a few features such as a following/suggestions option on the FYP. an easier setup for being able to see and read replys, I find it difficult to see the replys for a specific post. Another feature I would recommend is a like count on the account page.",positive
"No dark mode toggle. No alt text. No DMs. One main feed with public mixed in. No pinned posts. App feels very simple and basic with bare bones, which is less than most startups have had. This app is unusable.",negative
This app is not user friendly and it's tough to understand the app structure and home page options but and also there are a lot of bugs. I hope you'll fix all the problems in next apdate.,negative
"This is an Amazing app! I like how it performs, it's buttery-smooth and so fast, I wish they add couple of features to the future updates such as a following page, being able to edit Threads and DMs would be great. But overall it's a great social media app and I'm enjoying it right now.",positive
"Login was so smooth. No bugs, no lag. Just love the UI. Ofcourse it's not the finished product. Hope it will come up with more features. Cheers ✨",positive
"Well maintained. Loving it! But I don't know what's happening like when I try to post something with image, the app suddenly closed while selecting anything from gallery. Just check it out",positive
"So far so good! But I see that it should separate from Instagram and become a separate application. Also, a place should be added to the application conversations without the need for Instagram..",positive
"My thoughts First off, to log in you need an instagram account, in turn forcing you to get instagram. Second, twitter is just better as everyone is already posting there, making this app redundant. Positives are the name and the layout is kinda nice i guess but twitter is just better in every way. Its the first real twitter competitor in a while, yet it stands no chance.",negative
"I will give it a 4 but I hope soon I will give it a 5, the app is good by giving a head start by letting you link with your Instagram people fast. But can we please can you link it with IG messages or creating a messaging space also add story options if possible, but otherwise I love the app so much, I recommend it to everyone thanks for the app",positive
"Please fix the smoothness of the scroll, it is sometimes sticky and hard to scroll, and when i scroll fast it was like reversed and not going down, I don't if this issue is occured in other android version. So far this app is good even though it is new",positive
"This app is really a nice fresh start! I just want it to have some better function and ofc I know that it has just started so it is still in initial phase. FIRST, I want the post button on top not down since we have to close the keyboard to post. Scrolling also lags a little. Moreover hashtags??? We need hashtags to reach some kind of audience and I want to have a feature to search for threads.",negative
"It's really nice and comfortable. The simplicity hits (well) and it still is solid. Still waiting for dark mode, hastags, chat, a little etc though and probably more stuff.",positive
"Works fine. Everything's so smooth, please don't ruin the experience by adding unnecessary features, only implement the important ones. Don't make it laggy amd choppy like Instagram.",positive
"I like it right now, it's fun and I love seeing the reactions. I also like how they're numbers on your Instagram account telling you what number you are when you joined the account. Overall a 10/10 thought obviously as time passes my opinion will change. EDIT: i still like this and people need to give it a chance, as it has been only 2 days since the app came out.",positive
Very beautiful UI. But please make Likes & Quotes of a thread more prominent under it. & Yes we absolutely need a thread DM. Plus it crashes sometimes while posting threads. I hope it will be better soon. An amazing Application tho. Love it. 🫶🏻,positive
"Hello Threads team, I'm experiencing overlapping pages on the app, which makes it difficult to use. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but the problem persists. Can you please help me resolve this issue? Thank you, [Rajat]",negative
Worst experience on this social platform. The app crashes and the content inside the app Ovelaps each other can't even use it for a single time and can't even delete it. Just a waste of time very disappointed with @meta,negative
"The deal breaker for this app is the lack of ability to sort all the junk on the home screen to just what we want to see like people we follow. Without that feature, its juat random junk no one wants to read.",negative
"So far, this is an instant upgrade over Twitter. There are still some things I think could improve it (like the ability to edit posts), but overall, I dig it. Honestly, just go ahead and integrate all of IG's features into Threads, and you have an instant Twitter killer.",positive
"For an app that was rushed out, I must say that it works flawlessly for the limited features provided, but there's still a very long way to go. Hope Zuck doesn't give up. So much potential, even more so than Facebook I guess. Also, I hope it'll eventually be just called ""Threads"", and not ""Threads, an Instagram app""; Hinting at a dedicated login with its own sign up and login credentials. Good luck.",positive
"Oh dear, the app for android is still not stable yet, lots to fix, icons all over the place. I can't even view anything or is it my device. I shall try to install on another device. -Blackberry KeyOne, Android 8.1.0",negative
"Not even able to login !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - I use FB login to sign in Instagram, Now in this app shows only login using instagram and no option to login using fb. when click login it ask username and password of instagram, as I dont have one ! what do you think of fb logged in users then ! then WTH added login via fb in insta.. not not allowing in this thread.... WORST !!!!",negative
"App is interesting! I found one thing that enabled me to write this review. It doesn't show View translation feature for the foreign languages thread. I would be big plus for the users. Anyways, At the first impression it is booming!",positive
I barely opened the account and I already started receiving spam messages. It is so plain. You can't customize it. It doesn't even show much besides the things that you are not interested in. This app sucks.,negative
Ever since I installed it Instagram won't open or crashes. Heading to the bin unless this sorted asap. Android issue looking at multiple reports of same on Twitter. Also need a way to search posts by keywords to see feed of subjects I'm interested in.,negative
"Trash, if you are looking to see a Twitter killer, Sorry to disappoint you. It's been 3hours, trying to post a Thread but it's been crashing, and it ignores the threads of those you are following and shows you the posts of people it wants to. Lacks most of the features that makes Twitter lovely e g Hashtags, Threads is simply a crashing, bug filled Instagram. I didn't mention that it is data consuming and would advice you only use it on a Wifi that is not yours. In general it's a rubbish app.",negative
"The app is nice. However, the developer should include changing the username without syncing to an Instagram account and creating an account without using Instagram. I also find the news feed not organized, unlike Twitter. I hope this app will last and improve more.",positive
"I don't see a single thread or whatever it's called from the people I follow instead it's just random people indirectly begging for followers, and it isn't changing doesn't matter how many times I report/mute or block them. I can't use this app in it's current state neither I would recommend anyone else to.",negative
"Great v1 app and platform. Has helped hundreds of my friends and acquaintances migrate off of the bird app. Unlike a lot of other apps that have come and gone in the past couple years, this one feels like it's going to stick. 🤞",positive
"There's no way to see only posts from people you follow in chronological order, so you're never ""caught up."" Happy to try it again if they change that, but until then it's trying to be an infinite timesink and I'm not into that.",negative
"The app is easy to use and has a clean interface. It has all the features I need to stay connected with friends and family. I particularly like the community notes feature, which helps create a better opponent for Twitter. Overall, I would highly recommend this app to everyone.",positive
"There's a lot of glitches every time I just touch the screen, once I entered the app, it just started to glitch. I know this is a new app I'll change my opinion about it later if they'll fix it. Will try to restart my device I guess.",negative
"Refuse to use this until they enable a dark mode setting. I know it goes off of phone settings, but my phone's theme requires default settings and I like my theme more than I like this app. This should be a simple fix, as every other app this company owns has a toggle for dark mode. Get it done and I'll be a regular user.",negative
"Poor experience. Slow timeline, unwanted content on main screen, linked with Instagram so when you block someone there it will replicate to the other app. I would be good if we were in 10's",negative
"The app is great but needs improvement. Need DM integrated with the app, trending topics and also adjust the app design to be more identical to instagram, like the bottom bar of actions that has very different icons.",positive
"So far I absolutely love this app. It's so peaceful and upbeat letting me express my thoughts while following interesting other accts. I would just let ke three things so fingers crossed. DMS, bookmarks, and if at all possible an edit button for us misspelling writers. Beautiful work.",positive
At least one thing is true! We need a platform that is only text based social space! Threads and Twitter both are evolving into a multimedia platform - which is not really unique! Y'all still can be unique and don't mix it up!,negative
"There is a problem occuring in threads by scrolling or clicking anywhere, every post gets mixed with each other and if I click on requests replies, they also get mixed. I downloaded it twice but the problem is same.",negative
"Promising so far. Please make an easy way to switch profiles like we have on Instagram. Also, I shouldn't have to approve access every single time I re-log in to an account, only when creating Threads and importing from instagram. For users with a personal and business profile, this is an annoying hassle.",positive
Worst app I have ever seen in my life. It's so damn glitchy and buggy. As soon as I opened the app it started acting in a weird way. All the pages were overlapping and it was looks terrible.,negative
"so far, the app is great. It needs some improvements like adding hashtags and separating the following threads from those accounts you don't follow, you know, just like in Twitter. and it's hard to make an account. You need to create an insta first before you make thread accounts. I know that's actually connected with that app, but that can be a disadvantage of it.",positive
"The app is super buggy. Changed my insta password and I haven't been able to sign in. The loading takes ages and at times, images or videos just refuse to load. Work needs to be done.",negative
"It's OK, bur needs #1 bigimprovement needing to only show what I follow First over ""pushed content"" like I understand needing ads to gain money but I don't want a bunch of other content I don't follow blue check flood in the home menu. If I can expand on it's biggest issue twitter has ""following feed"" and ""for you"" while you only have ""for you"" (ads & recommended).",negative
"So far so good. Name is a bit confusing with a few other apps but liking the animated logo and familiar feel. It's new so needs some.time to bring features and functionality in (text search for threads a top one for me), but the core product is good.",positive
"very nice app but the user experience is so bad.... my account was restricted and it requires me to confirm that I'm a human by completing the reCaptcha, yes I have been confirming that since yesterday but the ""next"" button returns ""sorry, there was a problem. please try again later"". imagine since yesterday trying again trying again 😠😠",negative
"I'm looking forward to Fediverse integration, and the app already seems more polished in many ways than current Twitter, I just wish it collected less data than them too. Downloadable pictures, searchable posts, and followers-only timeline are missed too.",positive
"It's good but it's like Facebook & Instragram & what'app, twitter competition means that the thread needs to be changed a little more, pay is not working properly, the sound needs to be pressed on each reel, the keyboard is more important than the thread.",negative
Any potential thia app once had may have been wasted. Meta clearly rushed this app out the door without giving time to plan out and release updates at a good rate. It is ridiculously hard to grow on the app or see posts your actually intrested in. They don't even have an actual discovery tab or following tab. The apps been out for weeks now and has had virtually no changes. The lack of updates has killed any fun this app once had.,negative
"It's good that there's no ""Following Tab,"" please don't add Following Tab or if there's any plan to do it, just put the option to make it private. People don't need to keep overthinking about how many followers/following they have. And with no data about it, no one will feel superior to others just because of their follower/following numbers. Let everyone be real and be themselves. Oh, the most important thing, please let our home be clean from the celebrity accounts we don't follow. 😳",positive
"Nice great conversation & chat app 👍😍. Perfect great solution for asking open conversations (all comments, all replies, and all chats), sharing recent photos & videos, adding like to the recent photos & videos, adding stickers & GIFs, and of course being close friend with all Instagram followers no matter what situations & events it is 😍😍. Great better, easier, faster, and securable app 👍😍.",positive
"I have Android 9, and the app goes crazy once I open it. It is rendering all the screens at once, so whenever I scroll, all of it renders at once instead of rendering just one screen. Disappointed",negative
"This app has transformed my smartphone experience with its intuitive interface, customizable options, and smooth performance. It offers a diverse selection of content and exceptional customer support from the developers. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to enhance their smartphone experience.",positive
We need an organized feed that doesn't lose position everytime we move from it. Have it at least load a certain number of threads that will be shown next when we drag down to refresh the feed and so on. Such a basic feature,positive
"Kinda boring.. missing a lot of features or is hidden in the UI, can't find the trending topics for the life of me. The UI looks simple, too simple",negative
"It's good app but it should be more better if you add hashtags, Trending section. some time it automatically throw you out from the while scrolling. People who are available on thread who are also in our istagram account should be shown for suggestions because there is only one option in start follow all, what if we don't want to follow some of them.",positive
Threads is the best new social media app I've used since 2012. It definitely is not finished features are bare bones however it is a soild platform. I would recommend it. However it does not have messages or friends list or even a dark mode. Other than Facebook or Twitter it stands out!,positive
"As enticing as the concept is, for some reason, the application runs *terribly* on my device. Crashing when attempting to enter a thread and being unable to scroll through the notifications.",negative
"App crashes on Android, while trying to upload photo. Have already uninstalled and re-installed and logged out of account and changed all permissions. Was able to submit my first thread but any photo upload after that crashes the app...",negative
"This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform. AJ 505",positive
"Looks great. Just a bit complex, for now. Different threads look all packed up together. I think it should have the clarity of Twitter if it's going to be a major competitor. Great initiative though.",positive
"One of the smoothest app I have used, the reach is good and the UI is good as well, it helps to me change a window in no time and reach out to the new people faster than any other app, loved it. Precisely it has beautiful layout which could trend easily and as I have used it for longer I faced no issues. :)",positive
"I like it but more control is needed. Unlike twitter you can't turn off random people's feeds that you don't follow, I'm not interested in Arnold swartznegger or a bunch of randos. I'm interested in the people I follow and that's it. I also don't like that I had to go make a burner Instagram account I'll never use. I'll keep it because twitter is burning to the ground but for me personally I'd like more control over my content.",positive
"It a good apps for rivals Twitter but i hope this apps can have a dark mode option so sone people will not suffer for the light mode brightness. Plus please have an option like this from camera, this from Pinterest, this from Twitter and etc when we pick a photo from our gallery so the user don't have to search for the photo one by one. Hope you will improve it💜",positive
"Everything is smooth, but is there an update happening? Couldn't seem to open the ""following"" nor ""pending"" tab. I hope it'll be fixed! And also, add ""my liked posts"" tab, and a feature for hiding some posts/threads from specific followers only to be viewed, if that's okay. Overall, I love the new social media!",positive
Constantly crashing. Doesnt have any sort of friend/following tab or view. I don't see myself waiting around for the bugs to be worked out..,negative
"I admire what this app is intended for. Fixes I would like to see would include direct messaging, trending topics, keyword searches, pinned threads, profile banners, chronological timeline.",positive
Need to improve media support. You cannot copy paste images/gif via clipboard. Every time need to import it from attachments icon. Voice for videos is not working as well.,negative
"Not able to open the app. I just installed the application and when I click on open its automatically closed. Please fix it, it's giving a very bad experience to the users.",negative
"This app is very great since you can share your thoughts or whatever you want to share with it however, I'm experiencing some kind of error while using the apps like "" haven't posted any threads "" even tho I have already. But anyways, I hope it won't happen again because I need to uninstall the app and install it again to use it.",positive
Twitter but with more censorship and worse interface. It is altogether a very bad app and I would not recommend downloading it. You have to have instagram to even get into the app which is a pain. They will also deboost your posts and censor you from seeing others. Slow to load too. Stick with twitter as it is a much better app. Very bad do not recommend.,negative
Threads is a great app. But it still has to improve a lot. The first problem I had to face is that the profile photo doesn't open by clicking on it. The second problem is that the sound of the video is muted and the volume button does not produce sound.,positive
Unfortunately It's first time that a well known app is functioning so weirdly. All things were overlapping each other and I was not able to use a single function and infact it was so malfunctioning that I am not able to read a single line.,negative
"I really like threads it's like Twitter but doesn't have the subscription to it or the limit to view tweets. You also can follow to your favorite content creators, etc. If you can't find your favorite creator they will be in a pending box and once they downloaded it, it will automatically make you followed. And for the few days it's passed I've been really hooked to it, also for it's few days of the app being released I've seen many nice comments and posts. It's a really nice app I recommend.",positive
Seems to have a lot of similarities to Twitter which is great and integrated with Instagram also great. However the main issue I'm having is that I have multiple Instagram and Twitter accounts for different companies and personal accounts and there doesn't seem.yo be a simple straightforward way to switch accounts on threads without it setting off all of Metas security alerts and stopping me from switching accounts from within Threads itself.,positive
"Well, I'd love to use it but it won't let me post, I keep getting the 'Your thread failed to upload' message for days now. I tried clearing cache, force stopping, uninstall/reinstall...doesn't work. I'm giving it 2 stars because Instagram import seems to work and I could see other people's threads.",negative
It's good to have such a space to share your thoughts and create your content with words instead of media .. But I think that the home screen is too messy .. you gotta lower the count of non followed accounts threads in the home screen.,positive
"I love this app!!! Extremely addicting 🤣 but anyways I wanted to recommend something slight, I would love an option for a post to be ""close friends"" like on Instagram stories I would be elated! Because I am shy writing silly things infront of my extended family. (It would be 5 stars if the app had this option)",positive
"The app is too good as Twitter, and especially the app is connected directly to other Social Media apps but one thing to come in view is that the app contains many and confusing steps to SWITCH ACCOUNT. Look to Instagram and other Meta apps that contains easy and normal way to switch account quickly. Otherwise the app is amazing. My regards to Mark Zuckerberg 🙏",positive
"Liking the concept so far, could be fun. Only thing I wish for is being able to scroll through just the people I'm following, separate thread. Also, when clicking on ""follow all on Instagram"", needs to be an acknowledgement that it works. Seems like my pending list should be a lot larger.",positive
"Good first draft. It runs smooth and I am sure they will be adding functionality. I don't think they expected so many downloads right away but yet it doesn't crash. They seem to have only rolled out what has been well tested. Also, it's not filled with weird vaguely eugenicist posts by the billionaire owner, so that is cool.",positive
You have to log in with Instagram. Which in turn shares tons of information. So I looked at all the pictures of the app in use and realize that it is appears to be just be a copy of Twitter. Instagram and Facebook have been instrumental in censorship and data gathering and selling. I will delete it immediately.,negative
"Threads is an exceptional application that has greatly enhanced my social media experience. It offers a unique and efficient way to connect and communicate with close friends, making it easier to stay connected on a more personal level.😊😊",positive
"It's a great step, but I wish it was more convenient. Placing the comment and like button in accordance to your hand as I am a right handed I would like them on the right side. Double tap on like also needed.",positive
This app was unusable because of serious glitches. I couldn't see or scroll anything. To make things worse when I redownload the app I can't even login and app is keep crashing. Meta team should fire the testing team or they will lose billions in upcoming months . So far terribly frustrated with this product,negative
"Still kinda barebones for now, but it's not bad for a new social media app. It def needs some improvement on algorithm and such. Since it's a new app tho, I'll let it slide for now and hope they add more in the future.",positive
"Annoying - 2 stars coz well done for copying Twitter but it's not allowing me to post a thread. It keeps kicking me out when I try to type. Un-installed and reinstalled ☕ and now it just keeps saying ""posting.... view "" can see everyone else's threads, just not my own feed. I find all of this monotonous. How do i fix this problem?",negative
Very good app. I surprised to see a nice app to ditch Twitter. I hope Threads have feature to save picture like Twitter. Since personally i using save picture many times in Twitter. Hopefully dev will add that feature. And if can it will better if we can change region (not language) so i can get better recommended in for another country. Plus we need history to look what post we like before.,positive
"I'm partly a big fan of Threads. Very smooth interface, quick loading, and instantly compatible with my Instagram profile. However, there's a few issues. Firstly, not many celebs that I admire are on Threads yet - hopefully they will be soon! Secondly, I like downloading memes that people post on Twitter... But on Threads, there's no option to Save Image apart from to screenshot. Apart from that, Threads is a great app. I think I'll be moving from Twitter to here!",positive
"An amazing start, I wish this app be totally open, but I can sense that there will be a tone regulations comings which is why Twitter is so far ahead, you can literally find anything there, I hope they turn this app into a place for cute msgs and etc. Zuck should definitely make this into the real town square that Elon failed to accomplish.",positive
"I think Threads could be improved by adding more features, such as the ability to edit posts and the ability to switch between multiple accounts. Overall, I think Threads is a promising social media platform. It's not perfect, but it has a lot of potential. I'm excited to see how it develops in the future.",positive
Not a bad app it needs an update becoz whenever I upload video there is audio problem...automatically becomes muted ...u can also can't see live videos on threads ..only notification of live video is coming... Most important is there is login glitch... whenever I switched my accounts on instagram app ..the threads app also log out my account on threads app.. Every time I have to login my accounts on both apps..plz fix these glitches ..thanku,negative
Good app so far. A few requests: 1: Themed icon support for Android 13. 2: double tapping the search icon should go to the search page and show the keyboard (like other apps do) as this speeds up searching. 3: customisation like colours and things. Hopefully this will replace that other app..!,positive
The app is great but it's also fun*king annoying one minute I can follow someone the other minute I can't Sometime I can't even post really had a rough time with it but I love the app that's why I'm giving it 5 star please fix the issues And another thing it keeps blocking me out of the app some times saying we restrict so so nd so something like that pls fix the app,positive
"Haven't really explored the app yet, but a slight annoyance that I hope gets fixed soon. It'll be nice if we can switch between accounts like you can on Instagram. Signing out and back in all the time is a pain",negative
"Good experience. I am still learning new things about this app. I am taking more time to learn the total apps features. I didn't take this much time to learn features of an app. The overall user experience, animations, smoothness, are really good. Especially since it linked with insta account, I can directly use my insta bio in this app. It is totally connected to Instagram such made me easirler to find my friends.",positive
"The app is glitching. I just installed the app and when it opened, it wont show the posts properly. When I clicked the other icons, it justs mixed whats on the screen.",negative
"Instagram's Threads is a brilliant addition. As a photographer, the selective sharing with a close-knit circle is a boon. It's personal, smoothly integrated with the main app, and respects my aesthetic sensibilities. Overall, Threads gets my full endorsement - it's a game-changer in enhancing my audience connectivity.",positive
"So far, I like this application. It could use some features like gifs, maybe live stream etc. The tweets aren't repetitive as you scroll your feed, unlike Twitter, and it seems as though you can see everyone thread who posts on the platform, which is cool. Makes following new people easier. So far so good. I'm a meta Share holder too so with this new app I'll be buying more stock options. Lol 😆",positive
Just like Twitter! What was needed to make it like Twitter? & it has the biggest problem that is if we wanna delete threads also we have to delete our Instagram account. What is it?Whenever I want to click on it & start to scroll it starts to show me its glitching.I don't know why it's going on my app. I think some users are facing this same problem. Please fix it urgently. Also after hiding badge we need a option to reset it again on our profile. Please create this feature,negative
"I don't know whats happening on my app, at first it was working very well then when I try to scroll it's creating a feed page that I cannot read .... Things are moving up down.... Can you please fix t....but it's a good app definitely.",positive
"Love the Minimal but delightful UI. Please don't clutter it! The integration of haptics are awesome. The Scrolling smoothness can be improved though, it feels choppy.",positive
The fact that I can't delete my thread account without it also deleting my entire instagram is awful. I feel trapped. Separate them! Wish I had known this before I downloaded it. There's already bots and ads... I don't love it. It's also crashing every time I try to view replies to my threads...,negative
"Would be better if I could switch between profiles like on Instagram (without having to completely log out as it locks me out of the app). *also if you log out, it won't let you log back in unless you Uninstall and then Reinstall the app.",positive
There's a glich in the app.. Whenever I try to open it everything seems to be dragging and it's really annoying.. I tried after installing it again.. But it's still the same... I'm disappointed,negative
After 1 week use of threads app I found its not good because as per meta description there is no option for personal chat through inbox direct message. I still waiting for DM direct message features. I am getting regular many followers but I didn't talk anyone's person. So I would like to request you meta team please find the problem of direct message features and try to solve as soon as possible. 🙏🙏🙏,negative
"Great little side ""app"" to extend the features of Instagram, it incorporates similar page styles to Reddit although not all that comprehensive it gives a streamlined approach to the usual ""doom scrolling"" I've seen on other social media platforms.",positive
"Needs a lot of work in my opinion. Not getting notifications when those I follow post, all notifications are on, still nothing. Would love it if those I do follow are 1st on my feed. Also, a translate option would be great as I follow non English speaking celebs and have to screenshot posts for translation.",negative
"So far it's nothing new nor innovative, nor is it anything near Twitter - which is more smooth and users have more control over what is actually on their feed. That sluggish scroll this App has is very annoying and honestly quite irritating.",negative
"Title: Inadequate Formality: App Needs Its Own User ID, Separate from Instagram The decision to link it with Instagram is quite bad. If the app aims to establish itself as a formal platform, it must break free from this association and create its own user identification system. By relying on Instagram for user authentication, the app loses its independence and fails to establish a unique identity.",negative
"Sure, I'd be happy to review Instagram Threads for you. Threads is a standalone app from Instagram that was designed to be a more personal and private way to connect with your close friends. It's a great way to share your day-to-day moments with the people who matter most to you, without having to worry about your posts being seen by a wider audience. Some of the things I like about Threads include: It's a more personal and private way to connect. Threads is only visible to your close friend",positive
"I like the concept of the app, but I'm having issues with my timeline, it's not showing me the accounts I follow, no matter how many times I refresh the timeline, it shows me random accounts that I don't follow, and it's not because the users I do follow are reposting their threads, it's just giving me random accounts. I want to see the accountsI follow, I specifically didn't tap the ""follow all"" button when setting up my account because I wanted to follow specific people. Please fix this issue",negative
"So far I hate it, there is no way to turn off threads from accounts you don't follow. Im seeing threads from every account that has joined the platform so far. I've followed every guide to turning this off. I've changed every notification to "" only account you follow"" and I've turned off every category! I'm still seeing threads from everyone. It honestly makes the app unusable for me.",negative
"its okay! i wish we could look up what we wanted to see, like hashtags and a trending page. I dont really like the UI and it feels like an expanded notes extension that doesnt serve much purpose. But i like it overall !!",positive
"The app keeps crashing when I want to comment on a thread... I use Huawei P30 Pro. I have tried clearing cache, closing all apps, restarting the device, updating the app and nothing seems to work.",negative
"It started on a good foot and it can be better if it includes the following: -Save post and categorize/sort them in a folder -Close Friends, just like in instagram stories -trending topics under search tab -list, just like in twitter",positive
"This Instagram threads app doesn't seem to work properly on my phone and all the writing seems to overlap each other, plus it looks like it's either crashed or frozen.",negative
"I like the app, but please let us select album from the gallery for the attachment option. Will edit this after I explore the app. Everything seems to be at basic right now, let's see what will be added at first update.",positive
Home screen is full of people I don't follow and I have to search for people I follow individually. Just make the home screen like insta. Then when you search you can get the other suggested people. I'll give it a week then delete it if it's not useful,negative
"It's smooth & i love the fact that Threads have no theme colour, it's just white or Pitch Black. And, well for now it's in need for major upgrades. The settings ui, thread pinning, over-all experience. The point is, how different it is from Twitter & Instagram.",positive
"Much slow and bugs... Felt like a Juice product of instagram+twitter. It doesn't seems attractive or something new or interesting, maybe it will become best later with owners (@mark) interest - if he makes it compulsory to go beyond instagram. We're committed to use all the things as you deliver to us... Hope for the best. tnQ.",negative
"Best social media App so far,..to make make it all in one...can you modify the app to be able to have the LIVE option like facebook and also to be able to contact the owner of a certain account either through video ,audio calls or be able to text and send images or video to the owner of the account ( end to end encripted ) and i if one could create a group or community ( just like messanger or whatsaap ) for sure this app will be 👌.",positive
"This app does not support keyword search. As an active Twitter user, this is a showstopper, and the app is next to useless for me. Having that feature currently in the pipeline is understandable, but the fact that Meta decided to hype a beta version just to gain momentum over Twitter is embarrassing and disappointing.",negative
"It works. Easy to sign up (linking to existing IG), intuitive even for an elder millenial like me. I'm not a Twitter user and am just there for info, not to engage. Cleaner than Twitter's interface. Also, dark mode worked great.",positive
"My biggest problem with Twitter is that it has no “edit” button and I am an impulsive commenter. This appears to be the case with Threads. For me, Facebook will always stand out for having this great feature. Sometimes, I deliberately post shabbily on the App just to capture the musings. Knowing that I can always come back to flesh out what’s been wrongly done kind of endears the App to me. Mark Zuckerberg must quickly afford us this feasibility on the Threads.",negative
"Keeps saying it sent me a code to my cell to verify, however never got one. Then said I tried to many times. Then would not let me inform 24 hours only to have same to happen again. I got in initially on Threads and Instagram. Liked, followed then the above kept happening. Still can't use either.",negative
Definitely has the potential to work well. Needs to iron out some bugs with refreshing and more features. I expect the next update will be much smoother.,positive
"Just a small issue with dark/light mode. Can't switch between dark and light mode, even if you switch to light mode on Instagram, it stays in dark mode. Think you missed that. Everything else, dope 😎",positive
"The application is really great!The Ui and scroll is soo smooth.The animations are really good. I really hope this application stays this way, never add any other dumb features that you did to Instagram. For now Threads is a great place to be.",positive
"It's a Twitter like experience withour many of the issues Twitter currently has. HOWEVER my biggest gripes are how the algorithm suggests accounts to follow and places posts in my feed. For now, I find myself scrolling past lots of posts and accounts that mean nothing to me but Threads keeps putting them in my way. Once this is addressed, I think I'd be inclined to spend more time using this app but for now it's kind of tedious and boring",negative
The app is really better in comparison to Twitter. It's a good start. Just need some improvement... Mark Zuckerberg saved us from Twitter. 🤍 One more request There should be a Translate option beside every thread in the (...). Telegram is a good example. If any thread is not no English it'll show an option to translate in English.,positive
"It's pretty solid. The one issue I have is when I try to post photos, it keeps crashing and it stops working. I just want that issue to be fixed, everything else is ok.",positive
"Was rushed out the door, lack of features, and lack of pages/people to follow. Also the app uses a lot of personal data, so be wary of that.",negative
"I have to give it the lowest possible rating due to how awful the main feed algorithm is. I'm following tons of people, but constantly get screenfuls of posts from accounts I don't follow, and see many of the same ones repeated over and over. JUST SHOW ME WHO I FOLLOW!",negative
"Day 1 and I like it... so far smooth ui, potential for greatness... but some minor glitches and issues loading replies sometimes... would be nice to see number of reposts and quotes soon... room for improvements of course, but strong start.",positive
Need a draft for threads and sometimes it doesn't allow me to upload higher quality or size images and videos and even when that is the case it should mention the reason why the post was not uploaded rather than 'Unable to post' . Otherwise all good.,positive
"This app is great and so much better than Twitter, but my second day of using the app it start to crash or tine out once you open it. I had to uninstall to stop the crashing in order to see the house feed. Please fix problems",negative
Very annoying with that very Instagram feature where it thinks it knows better than I do and shows me posts from people I don't follow. Stop it! And if you want to ve a twitter alternative give us a chronological timeline and stop showing me people I don't follow. Up to the minute info is what newshead use twitter for,negative
Just show me who I follow. The timeline is too cluttered with random strangers unrelated to who I follow... Makes it very hard to use the app for more than 2 minutes at a time.,negative
"If you are to copy, you should be good at it. There is a lot is missing to make more Twitter. At the moment, it's labeled as a ghost town... we need to know the trending stuff and real-time news... add a search for content... not just followers.. if am to stay.",negative
"Being a first-week user, I've experienced improvement and better stability in just 10 days. Features are hearty at launch, learning curve is very low. Not pornified, no crypto bro or tabloid ad bombs (yet). Very stoked for Threads.",positive
Absolutely fabulous first day. I did notice Elon's buddies coming over and complaining a lot when they went back on Twitter. But they get mad because they do s***** things and then get caught. Other than that it worked really good. Cons are it needs an edit button and it needs a way to select the type of things that you want to follow for example politics animals etc. Have a great day I was really happy to see everyone show up.,positive
I see the appeal to leave the bird app but that's no excuse to roll out a half baked app. Search is not functional at all. No hashtags to find related or trending content. Videos with audio should unmute when I tap on them to play. No GIF support in posts. There's so much that needs fixing.,negative
"""Your thread failed to upload."" Useless app, nothing works except the feed which can't be sorted and search is only for names but no matter, clearing cache, uninstalling etc. it is still impossible to post or see notifications.",negative
"Intuitive app design, however, the inability to choose which Gallery app you want to use to select media and not being able to edit the media you've chosen are joykillers. Bookmarks missing is also something of note. Hope that changes soon.",positive
"Has a few glitches that need to be sorted out, but otherwise a solid improvement over Twitter. Looking forward to the updates when they start fixing bugs.",positive
"The app crashes when I try to post a photo. Sometimes, it allows one or two photos, but sometimes crashes when only trying to post one photo.",negative
"It's pretty good but it is a lot for the first couple of days. Baby steps, but I prefer wasteof.money because it's smaller. Edit: this is pretty good +1 star. The problem is the community is really abnormally almost annoyingly large.",positive
"A lot of potential, but it's still way too buggy. It's also way too sensitive on its auto-ban system. I'll follow 10 people, and then can't follow anyone else for at least 24 hours. Hoping Meta fixes all the issues soon so that I don't have to leave and come back later. Updating to say that they never respond in any way when you report an issue. 0 actual support.",negative
The feed is a real mess (like Instagram). I can't select to see just who I follow and can't be adjusted chronologically. Very frustrating.,negative
Excellent application! Such a great place for a conversation. But I've seen some glitches while opening the app. However the application running very smooth on iOS. Thanks to Meta 😄,positive
"Since you want to copy Twitter, copy it good, I can't pin posts, it's not colorful, I can't chat like on Twitter and Whatsapp, the logo makes me sick literally, why can't I bring back my barge on Instagram when I accidentally remove it and why can't our birthdays be announced, but I'm sure glad I have a second Twitter, all my suggestions should be sent to threaders and you should hear from them but please consider my suggestions, thanks.",negative
Created account. Account instantly suspended for no reason. Tried to appeal suspension and it needed to verify my phone number. Put in phone number to receive verification code. Code never comes. Try again. Code never comes. Try again. Too many codes requested. Try again later. What did I do wrong?,negative
"What's the point of following people if their posts never actually show up on your home tab? Instead all I see is random people posting about how much they like Threads, so it really just looks like the app is trying to make itself look good without actually doing anything useful.",negative
"It's a far worse version of Twitter. Only one feed filled with random accounts I have 0 interest in following. There's no hashtags, no related accounts pop up when you follow someone. Account is attached to Instagram, so you'd have to delete your insta account to delete your threads one and there's trending tab of course. It's not horrible but feels very rushed, random and insular.",negative
@globalrealtor _ An App that is very functional catches my fancy. I love the fact that it's seamless and I can easily network and run my Real Estate Business and other businesses I manage effectively. The beauty of this is meta has seen continuous improvement and innovation in this sector. I believe to see more of this soon.,positive
"This second I enter the app and touch the screen one time , it's over ! It's starts gliching like crazy comments get on top of each other and all you'll see is white . I deleted and redownload it 5 times and still them same problem.",negative
"It's really nice and comfortable. The simplicity hits (well) and it still is solid. Still waiting for dark mode, hastags, chat, a little etc though and probably more stuff........",positive
Phenomenal app. Account and profile and followers sync seamlessly with Instagram so I was able to jump right in with all my followers and followed people. The app is well-designed and fast. Far better than Twitter. I hope it keeps up.,positive
"A very good start as a basic social media app, the design is awesome and I love its details but of course there's a long way to go with the other features that need to be added for a better experience.",positive
"Good start, but would be nice to add a few new features. Hashtags, whats trending, and an option to switch between multiple accounts instead of logging out.",positive
"So far, nah. I'm not saying Twitter is good - because it's not - but even the app store I downloaded this app from has a dark mode. A lot of people have light eyes and can't handle bright things. White on white is actually painful to me. I'll update rating, if they add a dark mode.",negative
Great app twitter rival and a good one I used it on the first day of its release liked it. Mr musk is making twitter limited and pay for blue tick is very bad. Money can't buy everything. Hope this app will stay and more and more people come on this and this app should not follow the steps of musk and FB ads factory and keep our data save. Good luck treads.,positive
"So far so good, app is easy to use, tho it would be nice to be able to choose the photos from their folder instead of scrolling all the way down just to post it in the app",positive
"So far its great.needs some improvements here and there,like the algorithm for example.i really like the user interface,its very clean and its just a chill time in threads.hope it doesn't turn out to be like twitter",positive
"I downloaded it and didn't like it because of it is a replica of Twitter and offers nothing different and innovative. It is heavily biased too and you can get censored for sharing funny Zuck memes. Anyways, I then deleted the account and lost my Instagram of 7 years in the process because I didn't read the fine print. I don't recommend this. Stick to IG or Twitter.",negative
"I haven't had it long but so far it's pretty neat! The app functions well without lag/bugs, it's easy to navigate overall a pretty nice addition and a good alternative to twitter",positive
"Why can Meta not figure out how to make a gallery selection tool? Why do I have to scroll through all 12000 pictures on my phone instead of being able to select the folders or albums that I have made? Same garbage as Facebook. The only option when making a post is ""gallery"", about as useful as a poopie flavored lollipop (Patches O'houlihan, 2004)",negative
"I really love the THREADS, the design, the interface, the fonts, ans everything. I hope they will improve it more like the edit button, emoji design and add some trendings to know what's happening in our world. Such a great app! 🩷",positive
I don't see a point in this app. 1) I can't search for a specific post based on keywords. Or related topics 2) cannot know what is happening locally because there is no location based trends. 3) I don't understand the feed. It has nothing that I'm interested. I don't know why I'm asked to view those posts. 4) I cannot use the app to DM anybody.,negative
"The concept is great, but it constantly crashes and the more posts you mute concerning certain topics, the more you see if that topic. What's the point of the mute function if it does the opposite?",negative
"There's no filtering on the feed. It's just an endless stream of inane/pointless comments from people desperate for attention, begging people to follow them etc. This isn't a social media platform, it's a self promotion one. It wouldn't be so bad if I could filter to see content that I'm interested in but threads like ""I'm addicted to yakult"" are so utterly pointless. Like, good for you, super interesting, can't wait to hear about your favourite brand of toilet paper. Urgh.",negative
The app is having a big problem. I have logged in with my Instagram account. But when I scroll down to view people's post it turns white and also glitching. I have uninstalled it and installed yet the problem still remain the same. Although the app is nice but it having problem. Please fix it.,negative
"I'll start by saying I've enjoyed being on threads, when I can get on it that is, as it just crashes constantly, always when I'm trying to reply to people. And the problem is it crashes, I then have to remember who I was talking to or the thread I was on and find it again. Only for it to crash again and again and again. I'm at the point where its unusable in its current state. Needs a lot of work.",negative
"Search feature won't work. Yesterday morning it worked, in the evening and today simply doesn't work at all. Very frustrating when trying to find specific accounts which I know already are active on the platform.",negative
"Great App, very easy to navigate and understand, just some few suggestions please; 1. One should be able to view profile pictures 2. New followers should be placed the way they follow so one can easily identify who is following or not.",positive
"Terrible functionality with photos, images. Yup, it's Instagram, you can't zoom without autoreset, size and quality are bad, and yeah... you can't download it.",negative
"I was expecting a good app but it's totally second Instagram app. I was expecting app like Twitter because nowadays it's dead, people would come to this app if it's more advanced than Twitter... What i was expecting? It give bluecheck to those who has real names having nic id. It should be separate from Instagram It should not collect people's data It should have unique timeline (like Twitter). It should be more secure + very strict about people's self respect, filter bad words auto.",negative
"What is the point of creating an app that is litteraly facebook but as an instagram surfer. Moreover, you are copying twitter with all its specs and you got a new way not only to know every single detail about our lives but to actually know every single word we want to say. Try hard app!",negative
Just after I logged in all the pages started to overlap and I couldn't even use it. I even reinstalled the app 2-3 times but it didn't work. Please fix this bug because I wanna use this app.,negative
"Well, it's seems good start, but I have suggestions for the developer, the firsthing is a separated timeline, because it's so chaotic, timeline don't follow our interest, it's a random very-very random. Please make a better timeline, with all data you have I think this not to hard to implemented.",positive
"Stop forcing cross-platform user profile sync. I get your business model is to build data models of each of your users, but stop trying to farm me at every single faucet of online activity. Just allow a simple username/password to create an account instead of forcing users to sync from Instagram. I shouldn't have to create a new Instagram account just so my legal name is tied to an account for a new social media app that who knows what kind of secops are in place for.",negative
Privacy nightmare it is when you become a marketing object in meta ecosystem. There's no option to sign-in using using an email or any other ID. Ultimately by using your Instagram login you're exposing yourself too much for a company's business over the Internet showing your activities and views. That's even if you don't post anything because app tracks you 24/7.,negative
"Audio get mute when video uploaded, so many features have to improve, so any features not working properly. Need much improvement. I must say that it's unsuccessful imitation of Twitter. Finally I say it's totally BAKWAS App.",negative
I am using a device on Android 9 and the app is not functioning properly it glitches and the surfaces overlaps with eachother like its hacked or smn. Please look into it (update : it only happens in dark mode),negative
"New app new experience looking forward for more features, it's just launched recently and I downloaded it immediately and actually its easy to navigate.... But I suggest to add translation for the foreign languages that's all I find issues and I'll wait for new updates for new features 😍",positive
"Okay, it's impressive. I use Tw because it's more comfortable than Instagram because it much give us a text than a picture. Where picture is the reason why Instagram is more being used by children which it makes me uncomfortable with them. But now, there is Threads for Ig user, so I would like to choose it.",positive
"Not to shabby for a start, but it lacks features. I also don't like how it collects data and the fact you can't delete your threads account without deleting your Instagram account. I'm sticking with Twitter until they can figure it out.",negative
Nice app Feels like Twitter and Instagram just had a baby....... twinstagram..... lol But it's a new app and with all new apps there are things to fix... example....we need to be able download pictures and videos to our phone library without having to screen shot or screen record......thank you,positive
Very glitchy first experience. While scrolling all the text leaves a trail of itsself and doesnt get refreshed. So it's hard to scroll and read.,negative
This is honestly one of the best apps ever. I am glad this doesnt have adds. One suggestion i would like is that when a person you follow repots something- there should be an icon that will notify you instead of having to go to their profile. This is truly a nice app,positive
"Slim downed Twitter, but better! The community has embraced positivity over negativity for the most part and the overall app experience has been great. As a new app, very feature light but easily usable for text-centric conversation and news",positive
"This app is amazingly good and pleasingly perfect for me, although there is some features and interactive thing that need to be added and fix but I would definitely recommend you to download this new app because it's so professional,ethical and great.🥰🙈",positive
"This has potential. Still needs some updates to make it usable fulltime. Needs: -Following only feed in chronological order -Start feed where you last read, current feed jumps to top -Allow third party apps access Do that and I'm done with Twitter forever",negative
"Twitter clone that shows you a bunch of stuff you from accounts you didn't follow, and doesn't let you turn that off. It has potential but in it's current state it's just a feed of spam from ""verified"" accounts with the occasional post from your friends.",negative
"I was able to post thread, but now all I get is ""Your thread failed to upload"" whenever I try. I can post replies, but no new threads. I have cleared cache, reinstalled the app, and I am on a good network. Yet, I still can't post. Help me fix this issue and I will change my rating.",negative
The app is full of glitch. Can't even scroll the feed section as it shows only some glitchy mess. I think the app does not support in every phones. The app is a complete glitch in my phone (Redmi Note 8).,negative
"Your notification system really needs to be improved. I clicked the bell for some account but it doesn't change anything, I always miss their updates.",negative
"Lacking a lot of features and functionality, so the user experience is currently far inferior to Twitter. Really only useful to people who have a large following on Instagram, the growth potential for smaller accounts is virtually non existent. Nice clean UI tho",negative
"So easy to sign up if you are already on Insta. Like the interface, but they need to make some changes so that people can differentiate the posts easily. Rn It takes some effort to be able to tell apart which post belongs to whom",positive
"Good start. Hot for a minute but hype has died. Please modernize app for foldables (Twitter is). I'd like to keep it open while doing other tasks. Also please add features to differentiate app from Twitter. Right now it's a lesser clone. Once the new app hype dies out, people will see it's not better than what already exists.",negative
This app doesn't work in my Android phone like seriously 🙄 whan i start this app and touch the screen all words starting glinching like a bugs or something all texts starting brurr and fly..... Very bad bcoz everyone using this app peacefully and i can't even open it without getting glitch.,negative
"It's a good apps, but there is much things that needs to improve. We can't edit the photo, we cannot choos the photo from the album.",negative
"This app is amazing! It could use features like GIFs and live streaming. Unlike Twitter, the tweets aren't repetitive and you can easily see everyone's threads. It's making it so much easier to connect with new people.",positive
"A very good application. I am happy to be one of the first to register in this new application. I hope to become one of the content creators and among the most influential people on the Threads platform. It also seems that Mark is very ready for me to compete with Elon Musk hahaha, good luck for the best of course 👋🏻 I wish a lot, Mark, if you put it, especially watching videos of Reals such as Facebook and Instagram, as it will have a great impact in attracting a large number of users. 🇩🇿📍",positive
"Good experience, smooth till now (till the meadia, reel nd filmy people joins for promotion) , needed some tweaks - feature to make it most interesting. Pls keep this text oriented as much as possible.",positive
"Buttons are very unresponsive, theres no feed with people that i follow, and no text search (only account). Needs a lot of work. Also you can only log in via instagram.",negative
"Unbelievable this app, even after 2 years of development, decided to launch w/o hashtags, a following-only feed, translation for posts and other basic features that are standard with social apps. If you want a Twitter alternative that serves you better, Mastodon is by far the only one.",negative
I like the app since you can share it to Instagram and also it is so high quality but one thing is that i want to see on my feeds like the accounts i followed seperate to those people who's using the app because for me only it's kinda messy. Or maybe im stupid to didn't know the meaning of the app well myself didn't like other people. I love yll,positive
"Nice 👍 , But need but some features are missing... like DM, place to find liked posts... can't add hashtags as well. Hopefully in the coming days, we will see the features added and some more added features.",positive
"Installed the app. Its not working right. The screen if tapped into anything aftrer opening the app, shows a buggy window just like in the past with slow internet connection! Redmi note 5 pro!",negative
"This is what Twitter wanted to be until they changed their management and ruined it by letting rampant hate. Longer posts, simple engagement, just better Twitter. It just needs to continue to add things like video, gifs and such. Happy with it. Happy to have SWITCHED to it.",positive
"The app seems pretty slick. It's missing some basic things like icon theming, being able to insert gifs / images from the keyboard, etc. Also people you don't follow show up on your feed.",positive
"Just an FYI, a lot of these bad rating are from Twitter, and they don't like how it's not up to their expectations cause they are used to how Twitter is. Definitely not the app for them. Threads is new and more for the audience that is on tiktok kind of way. So, of course, they are gonna say the people posting on there sound stupid we are young and posting for our audience that find things funny and entertaining in our interest.",positive
"Literally just Instagram and twitter merged Nothing extra In fact would even say its worse than twitter, twitter shows likes replies etc. With an icon and a number in a much cleaner way Also once you sync your Instagram and threads u MUST have the same handle on both? Also there are still bots....",negative
This app is clearly very poor tested and improved. All the texts overlap and smudge on scrolling. All the defects start just after logging in and is endless...,negative
"as a new app it's good for the time being, but I highly recommend to add a dark theme setting and post translation cuz I don't understand all languages . but all in all , my experience is good 💯",positive
Dear Instagram Please work on the existing bugs & issues before launching any new features. I have been repeatedly reported an issue regarding Instagram reels from past 4 months. Kindly give a response at sort it at the earliest.,negative
Recently joined this app. App is still in the development stages and many things are missing. However. I absolutely loved the competing app before new owner tore it apart. I think Meta owner and his Executive have potential to tear ceiling off that and may have learned something from competing owner's recent failed experiences. I have much hope for Threads!,positive
"I like the simplicity of this app , it is new but it's so easy to understand about the features. the edit profile view card feature impressed me most.",positive
"A fair warning: using this app gives facebook the right to all your data, and you can't delete the account without deleting your instagram account. Aside from that issue, there is so much basic functionality missing. How did Facebook (Meta) ever greenlight this app?",negative
"Decent. Lots of issues in reloading, Mark Zuckerberg page is not even loading. Search bar sucks. Apparently searches only people and not keywords. Should come up with an alternative like #hashtags. No geo location which was basically made famous by Instagram. No DM feature.",positive
I personally actually really like it. No random crashes. The transition between Threads and Instagram is also very seamless. Can't wait to see if they add new features (Voice notes/Spaces) lol,positive
"Showing much glitches ..and letters, sentences, words are collapsing with each other.. tried to reinstall it several times ...but still the same result... Fix it soon..",negative
"Well this sucks... This is not like Twitter, nor a Twitter replacement, because it seems that the only way to use/sign-up to use this app is by already having an Instagram account, and/or creating an Instagram account.. So if there's a way to independently sign up on unable to find it.",negative
When I first download it worked perfectly fine but now all the articles are merging on top of each other every time I open the app. This glitch is so bad that I can't use it at all.,negative
Amazing app. Just needs more optimization. Like you have to add accounts in the starting if you have more than one accounts. You can not have more than one if don't add them in starting ❤,positive
"Such a bad app, doesn't even work on my phone. Everything starts getting cluttered as soon as i scroll or go to any other page. Really bad experience. Could've at least tested and published a beta release 🤦‍♂️",negative
"I think audio should be automatically enabled while posting but right now it's disabled until you enable it. Hence, lots of videos posted without audio.",positive
"I like the app though the DM feature is very welcome. Additionally, additionally, a home feed just for people you follow would be good ADD HASHTAGS! I'd recommend that you also find a way of showing us what's trending. With proper implementation of user feedback, twitter won't be the primary go to app. One more thing, avoid censorship!",positive
"I'm not able to deactivate my account. When I click on deactivate, I'm immediately logged out of my account. But the case is it's still visible to my friends and to check I tried to log in back immediately and my account was logged in which means that my account is not deactivated, if it was then I would not be able to log in back immediately. I request you kindly look into this matter and do something about this immediately. Also I faced the same issue with Instagram sadly.",negative
I cannot even use the app. It just breaks down into a mess of text and repeated images. It's so bad it would get top page of r/softwaregore,negative
Definitely needs some work to be done on it (lacking a messaging feature and switching accounts takes longer than it should) but a really solid social media platform.,positive
"I like the idea of this app, but there's an issue because mine is not working properly because it's bugging, like the text is and some of the pictures are not moving and not syncing, and I wish this would be fixed immediately so we could use it.",positive
"Very confusing timelines. please add features to view by following only or add custom list view. i dont need to see random artists threads, because it's annoying. also please add theme background to dim / black, because it's too bright.",negative
The app is unusable for me. The screen gets overloaded with text. I can't see anything properly. It's almost like if it's glitching. Please help,negative
In it's current state this app is awful! I can't even find any threads that the people I follow might have posted. They are lost in seemingly hundreds of random posts from random people all around the world. I have deactivated my account until Meta gets round to producing an option for you to just see posts from the people you follow!,negative
I'd like it more if it would stop booting me out every time I try to reply to anyone. What makes it worse is when I open it up again I can't find the thread I was replying to. It would also be good if it was easier to use gifs and search for topics you're interested in.,negative
"I believe I may be the first person to write a review about this app, and I already love it. However, Threads takes the crown as the best. I think it would be beneficial if they added a message button, allowing users like me who don't have large accounts to reach a wider audience as well, because I noticed people that is enjoying it the most are people that have large audiences on Instagram, my account joshdehustler, still never breathe sha",positive
"I like the app though the DM feature is very welcome. Additionally, additionally, a home feed just for people you follow would be good 🤌🏾. ADD HASHTAGS! I'd recommend that you also find a way of showing us what's trending. With proper implementation of user feedback, twitter won't be the primary go to app. One more thing, avoid censorship!",positive
"The app keeps glitching, I've deleted it and installed it multiple times but it's still bugging, I can't rate it right now because it's not working, can you please fix it 🙏",negative
"Cannot even scroll my newsfeed. It is so glitchy and when I scroll something, it looks like trailing. If I can attach pictures, I would've attached the screenshot. Please help me rectify it.",negative
"Unless I'm missing something, it doesn't appear that you can sign up for an account directly in the app. You must create an Instagram account first, then use those credentials to sign into Threads.",negative
"please add favourites as an option just like what u have on ig just so I could choose whom accounts I want to see and interact on my feed. also, please put some features where we could see whom on my followers and following I haven't followed and whom doesn't, it gives us confusion once u hit a hundred followers. thank you! I enjoyed the app so much",positive
"Interface is good but add more features like twitter polls, spaces, dm, bookmarking, send to dm. Also on Twitter when you open it you are exactly where you left while on here the for you page is really messed up.",negative
Not even close to compare to Twitter. It's an Instagram with a different layout. Same strict rules and awkward format. Impossible to search for posts rather than people. It may be a good alternative to Instagram but not to Twitter.,negative
"The whole app crashes each and every time I attempt to post my first thread. I've cleared cache and reinstalled it, yet the problem still persists. Very bad.",negative
"It's great if you're comfortable giving Zuckerberg and therefore the Feds via backdoor, access to every activity, keystroke, every last bit of data (meta or otherwise ) and every piece of personally identifying information in real time . For the purposes if selling information about you to advertisers so they can better persuade and predict your next purchase and squeeze every last bit of value from that data by auctioning it off to the next data broker.",negative
"Pretty descent so far, definetly has potential as i see it. One big thing is a bug where i try to add a photo to a thread and it just closes the app wiping the thread and any text",positive
"Thanks to threads app my Instagram has a bug now.. Every setting is altered.. Most of app features that i used regularly, are unfunctional now Can't even restore them with my updated app.. Tried every kind of thing,even reported it to tha meta center,and it is still unresolved..",negative
you people really need to add a permanently deleting option which doesn’t concern the Instagram account. ik It's a great marketing strategy and all but it’s getting annoying. when I thread stuff I don’t want people to know my actual Instagram account. that was literally the whole point of anitwt. ughhh It's getting annoying.,negative
Just doesn't work.. I see posts but no replies instead it only says something went wrong.. And can't post anything only said post failed to upload. As it is now it's useless and I would hate going back to twitter.. I tried every suggested fix that can be found on the Web.. Nothing works..,negative
Trash. This is a waste of time yall. They keep distracting us with bs instead of dealing with real life. Why do i need to see how everbody feels especially when u wont allow me to see content from people i follow unless i tap on each of their page. Why would i be interested in peoples content that i do not follow. Its like there forcing you to engage virtually and not go outside stay woke,negative
"""Threads is a fantastic app developed by Instagram that lets me share photos and videos with my close friends and family just like on Twitter. The app's design is exceptional and it's the perfect platform for staying connected. Highly recommend! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐""",positive
This new app is very amazing! It's just that once you've reach a hundred followers you can no longer track the accounts that you need to followback. I think it would be better if we can easily track or check it. But over all everything is so great. Congrats! ❤️,positive
Why does the cursor change automatically to random places when threading? I bring back the cursor but it keeps going back to mid sentences as if INSERT button is turned on that eats up the rest of the sentence as I keep typing.,negative
"The app keeps crashing whenever I'm trying to reply. Additionally, Idk if it's because of the phone or what but I cannot see what I'm typing, I need to close the keyboard to see what I wrote and continue.",negative
"Overall, it looks clean. Though it would be nice to have a collaborative feature where users can do a space to talk and share ideas in the future. Also, maybe we can have an option to create a separate account for Threads and not require an instagram account.",positive
"It won't even let me in when I go into the app, it wants me to enter an 8 digit number backup code, and it sends a text with a 6 digit code, so I can't even get past that screen.",negative
It is a good app and overall good concept but I guess it is better if u add chat option and stories with the new updates. This is just the beginning. I hope we will see good later,positive
"I can't even use it. as soon as I open it, it starts to bug or something, all the pages and post are overlapping. I can't even reed or interact with anything.",negative
"Very certain in it if they provide and maintain what Twitter has achieved through these years, perfect timing for it. Able to use Insta ID's is such master move. Loved it. Congrats and hoping it to be bigger than any other platform. 🤍",positive
It has nice interface. Simple and elegant.minimul look with some refreshing features. Quite impressed with thread. Keep improving guys. And well done.,positive
Great app But hey i am having some problems hope you improve them 1. Please block all Policy breaking tread Writers . 2. If it is possible that we also can see what Posts Others are liking then it would be great like We can see in twitter. 3. A seperate counter for what is going treading now ...on threads app Like trending hashtags ... trending post ... trending Video etc . 4. App is crashing .....after a little using this app is crashing.i am using xiomi redmi note 8 mobile.,positive
"It doesn show the replies in posts. It shows something went wrong. The only screen that works is the wall, for all the others it shows something went wrong. How possible a giant company makes such a trash application",negative
It's just like twitter I guess but the glitchiness is making it almost completely unusable. If I could upload a photo of what it looks like I would. It's headache inducing.,negative
"Damn ! It's so simple to use , i feel this is a game changer ! Twitter is not bad but a little complex ! But here on threads it's supper simple ! Attractive look , beautiful experience out there ! Highly recommend it be used by all ! Setting up profile was super simple ! Loved it ! .....sorry to say RIP TWITTER......🥲, You will be remembered!",positive
"Almost two hours of background usage on a day I used this app at most 5 minutes, same happens frequently with Facebook and Instagram so I end up switching the to Restricted Background Usage... Meta data collection is really intensive apparently.",negative
"There is no search function, so it's impossible to find info by topic. There is no chronological feed, so it's impossible to find very recent news. For example, Trump's valet was just arraigned, but searches for ""valet"", ""Nauta"", ""Waltine Nauta"", etc, produced no info, so I had to go back to Twitter to get the current info.",negative
"I downloaded this for the first time which is today, the problem is it keeps glitching... I already reinstalled this app 3 times and whenever I open it, it still glitch like the whole screen of threads is glitch that I can't use it at all. Please fix this asap.",negative
"Very nice app, but its missing a few things such as switching accounts, hashtags, taking pictures, etc Its very smooth and well optimized, unlike instagram for Android which is ironic",positive
"This is the beginning of something big. But I think there's somethings missing on the platform that will make it more user friendly. such as; 1. ""Trending news"" lemme name it as ""Trend Threads"" 2. For android users too we can't go through the albums of your gallery, you just have to scroll till u get to the media you would love to ""Thread"" 3. There is no ""hashtags"" Please fix them for us e trust you 👍💯🙌",positive
"Installed the app. Then, I couldn't even create an account. You can only log in with your Instagram account. I neither have nor want an Instagram account. I was hoping this would be a viable alternative to Twitter, but I guess not. Great job Zuckerberg, you really missed an opportunity here.",negative
"Terrible. Because of Instagram's overly cautious account policy, I think Instagram itself treats Threads as a 3rd party app and because of it I've been getting constantly logged out of Threads as well as Instagram despite they are designed as intertwined apps. This is such a huge failure on Meta's part yet again. Please fire the development team of Instagram and stop with overly cautious log in policies.",negative
"So far I am loving this app, but it really needs an EDIT option so we can go back and fix typos. We all make them sometimes and it sucks having to delete and rewrite a post. Please, please, please add an edit option 🙏",positive
"This app is awesome already, but I do have a few suggestions. First, you should be able to like a thread when it's shared to an Instagram story, either by having it redirect to the threads app or straight from the Instagram app. Second, you gotta make it to where you can search for threads using keywords. Instagram has hashtags, so you could even let me search using those. Dodge and weave those lawsuits ! 😛🤔🧨😈",positive
"Not working, as soon i touch ut to scroll it a little, it washes the screen with words like when you scroll very fast and never stops just have to close the app then.",negative
Wow! I can't believe. This is really a fantastic and user-friendly application from Meta. Perfect application for Instagram users. Meta really satisfied us with this gorgeous application. Just gorgeous! Highly recommend it.,positive
"Pleasantly surprised, I actually am enjoying it. Gave up on Twitter a while back and seems like this is an easy to use alternative. Not perfect, but it's brand new so I expect that. Give it a try (and delete twitter!)",positive
"Not the Twitter replacement I hoped for. Feed is full of algorithm-chosen randos, can't limit it just to the people you follow, it's a privacy nightmare (read what it ties to your account), you can't delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account, and no sign of the Mastodon integration.",negative
"It's full of spam of accounts I don't follow and are not even related to the ones I do, is extremely annoying to a post of one of my friends and another 20 of strangers, blocking and reporting should be easier and once done should automatically mute that person's threads, and above all is no dark theme, so far not liking it at all",negative
"It's awesome , a minimalistic twitter , no bugs , smooth app . It's just that the like , share , comment buttons not on the right side since I'm right handed . But overall I love it",positive
"As soon as I login it started acting weird and every pages loaded on each other,what a bug or its a crash ? Even reinstalling can't fixed that , please solve this issue",negative
"Smooth very nice. I have suggestion, please add hashtag search, so we can find others thread whos using those hashtags. And maybe link? With the device browser popup, dont use threads browser popup itself, So we can easily login or approving login api's when connecting on something. Because the caches or data history is only on our device browser (chrome or firefox etc)",positive
"For a version #1 , this is a fantastic app. Needs some more features to make it a daily app for me, such as chronological view of posts from only my followers vs an algorithm that is now feeding me NFL and MLB and other posts that I have no interest in.",positive
I have never liked Twitter UI and it's interfacing and now after using threads it's really app that can replace Twitter because in Twitter the pages load times are too slow and it's unreliable too. Thread is great 👍.,positive
"Pretty decent UI so far, but checking other people's profiles take a bit before they load. But overall, it's a pretty decent experience. It's not as filled as Twitter content-wise, but it will get there soon enough.",positive
Having rendering issue.. the app opens well but the moment I tried to scroll everything collapses ... It like every text overlap with each other.. How to fix it ??,negative
"Without a proper search function I don't see why this would even claim to contend with Twitter. It took me 10 minutes to lose interest. Might be useful for following friends and idols, but then why another app. Meta has a bunch of them.",negative
"While the app is a good one,I can't post media on it,anytime I try to post pictures and videos,the app just closes... It's frustrating!!",negative
Bad experience I think. It's been 5 days of use of thread 🧵. I have got alot of problems using thread because we can't save photos here we cant enter and give a long space here that makes a problem. Along with that there are alot of problem this app can probably replace twitter in future 😔 yea I am also sad a out that but watching it's exponential growth over days I can easily predict it's potential in market. I hope thread can solve challenge user facing and makes a good user experience ✨,negative
Looks clean for now but it has lots of bugs like when to try to increase or decrease the volume of a video it's doesn't work if you refresh sometimes app creashes feed refresh is very slow.. but hope it improves,negative
"Great app, Inside a thread need to minimise padding between 2 threads, overall the whole theme seems to be too much dark, can add other tones as well like Green, red, blue to create some dynamic feels. Overall Great app",positive
App is very unstable. The words in an entire screen mesh in the worse way possible once I scroll down through the threads. Can't even read anything,negative
fold 4 english review: works ok on fold but locks into only 1 oriantion when on the inner screen. when using it in dex complains that some dex features will not work. general thoughts: instagram with option of only text posts? there is no # hashtag searching. no searching for topics. as a social app its kind of hard to be... social.,positive
"Honestly, I haven't had many issues. I do want to see more functionality on this app. When I hit play on videos the sound doesn't play.",positive
This app is a great throw back to old school Twitter. Highly recommend this over Twitter now. The algorithm shows you things you want to see versus Twitter which shows you paid users first. Over all and exciting challenge to Twitter that I'm all too happy because part of. You also cannot pay your way to being seen over others making it more fair than twitters current system.,positive
Well Great Execution may be a copy 2 Twitter but looks quite intresting... Of course some developments yet 2 b done like - 1) Increase d word limit in bio coloumn 2) It takes lot of time 2 post any thread 3) Multiple options in COLOUR & FONT makes more attractive,positive
"I think when we get better functionality like the ability to only see posts from who we follow, and maybe edit abilities, it will be great. The potential is there.",positive
"Idk if the app has an issue or if it's something else but I know people I have been following have been making posts and I do not get any mobile notifications about anything related to this app at all, other than that first impressions of this app is it's pretty decent for using it for only an hour plus no rate limit is nice 😂. Fix the mobile notifications or help with making them pop up and we're good to go here!",positive
"Meh, there is a lot of other threads that i have scroll past to find people I follow. Adding those accounts to the block list doesn't diminish the amount of unwanted theads. The plus side is that if you have a pretty extensive sponsored ads block list in IG, that was carried over.",negative
so far so good. the app has been running very smooth since day one for me. there's still more features that should be implemented but overall pretty solid.,positive
"Not somethings I would expect from a giant like Meta. I'm aware that the app has been out for literally 2 days but all the contents of the screen started glitching as soon as I got to the ""home feed"". I can provide more information if the dev team is interested.",negative
Overall a good experience and I think it has the most potential for getting Twitter's place. A quick feature request: - Please add RTL languages support.,positive
"The app sucks. The navigation is terrible, as if you were on a poorly-designed web site. It also sucks that threads dot net cannot be browsed like Twitter or Mastodon or Reddit or etc. Please stop pretending that Threads is not a web site and that your app is not just a half-a§§ed web browser.",negative
Add auto translate since an app like this is more likely to letting people from different countries socialize with each other. Just keep improving! I'm boutta leave the other app cuz they ask for money to get extra features. 🥲,positive
"This app has filled up my timeline with profiles I don't even follow! It defeats the whole purpose of ""following""🗑️ I'm going back to twitter. If this is not changed, I'm deleting the app altogether. Nonsense!",negative
Hope there's more option to access my media like using my phone's integrated albums app. It's kinda hard to add older media since I have to scroll down my whole gallery.,positive
"Just new face behind other! 1 . Its just a new look behind insta . 2. All apps r attached to each other, fb and insta . 3. Probaby security and reporting system would be same and i am already blocked on fb and getting threats to lose my insta . So it will also be more like threats than threads. 4 . U cannot log in through google. And it cause u to make a new profile, after making it, it says passwore incorrect or user not found. 5. Alot more needs to develop. I cannot restore my fb accoun.",negative
"Trash. Your feed is randomized, so good luck reading the messages of the people you follow or vise versa. It's an algorithm based monstrosity to further put obscure creators in the dirt. Everyone influencer is racing to get followers via the randomized tweet (or whatever) display. I want to support fellow artists, not be subjected to more hivemind monotony",negative
The interface has miniclones of itself all over the place and they are overlapping each other. Can't see anything clearly.,negative
"The second I tried using this app, it started glitching so bad. I tried restarting my phone and even the app itself but it still happens, can you guys fix this ? I would really like to try this aoo without all the glitches.",negative
"Simplicity at its best! I love how simple the UI is whilst providing a peak User Experience! I'm not even going to lie, this is easily the best social media product that has come out in years.",positive
Overall better than Twitter It's missing a couple of minor features that make Twitter a little bit better like your header but past that it's basically the same but better because elon's ruined the Twitter platform. Apparently there's some bugs that you should be aware of if you go installing this. I haven't experienced one.,positive
App is Amazing and I'm happy to use this.As Qa engineer I say that user experience is good.. But There are some bugs in App please fix it soon as possible Ex:- While writting ur bio clear and rewrite then it effects to previous sentence.. I have recorded a video..,positive
"I hate that we need to login with an Instagram account. I don't want an Instagram account, poorly developed!!! The proper way to develop this is by creating a main Meta account, and using SSO to login each app. In your Meta User settings, the user should be able to choose which apps their Meta account can access, so they should be able to activate or disable FB, IG, Horizon, and Threads.",negative
This is a really great app! No wonder new users are growing exponentially. Word of mouth advertising is the most trustworthy. Thanks for the tip! Threads is a God send after the train wreck that is now Twitter.,positive
"Doesn't even work anymore, it was fine for about a week but at some point I could no longer see my own profile or activity, it just says ""something went wrong"" I reported it but that black box of a user support system doesn't even inform me if the report went through and no reinstalling the app didn't work",negative
It's quiet pleasant. I really hope you are open for more improvements such as a button for media so we can see our photos/videos related posts. Or likes button so we can see our liked posts. Also I hope you add hashtag feature for the future improvements.,positive
"It's super buggy, i can't see anything much because the graphics/lines/texts, smears on my screen...the only redeeming feature i like was syncing contacts with my instagram account",negative
"A good start for Threads. However, I would like an option in Threads where my feed displays content exclusively from the accounts I follow and not to be overwhelmed with posts from celebrities whom I don't follow. And probably see what's trending at the moment. 🩷",positive
"This app run poorly or is it only applicable to certain android models? There are many glitches, bugs, and incorrect bahasa spellings in several places (fine when i used english) i hope it gets fixed soon because this platform seems enjoyable",negative
"so far so good. a few days ago the app would keep shutting down, but uninstalled and reinstalled and that fixed it. Gotta add a way to go back and edit threads for spelling and revisions. Once its posted no way to change/modify what u posted...😕",positive
I am using on Redmi 6A. It's compatible with my device according to description but when I installed and opened it after creating the account when I tried to use it whole the screen gets blurry with text as I swipe up.,negative
"My just created account got suspended right off the bet before I even saw a single thread. Sending a confirmation SMS does not work. You cannot delete your Thread account without deleting Instagram. Then I saw they want access to pretty much ALL your data including financial, health, shopping, etc Don't expect this app to be in the EU anytime soon for a good reason.",negative
"So far it's been pretty OK. My feed is nothing but celebrities I do not care about at all and none of the people I follow. Seems to be no way to toggle that yet. Once that becomes a thing, I might raise my score. Having no ads (yet) has been lovely but that'll last *maybe* two days.",negative
Great application. Please do not run ads. We also hope that the messages and updates feature will work in a distinctive way. Thank you,positive
The app is lagging a lot. The screen freezes at first then all the texts gets overlapped. Images are displaying fine.,negative
"It would be nice if we had a ""For You"" and ""Following"" tab on the homepage. We could also make the scrolling animation smoother, like on Instagram, and add a trending page.",positive
"It's showing some weird glitch effect, tried installing multiple times, after opening the app n scrolling the text is glitch n it just looks like a very low fps video, waste of data",negative
"Theads ! A unique name with a new experience by Instagram,it's crazy and easy to use because of attachment of Instagram account,which access people easily. And it's amazing.",positive
I like it so far. It would be nice to have drafts and the ability to deactivate our accounts without deleting our Instagram profile. Edit: Also please separate the people we are following and posts from suggested people because it is quite annoying.,positive
"Never seen such a glitchy app before! It's lagging continuously, cannot do a single scroll or even see my own profile page. If this doesn't work in next few hrs, I'm certainly deleting it 🤬🤬",negative
"Can't create an account with the username I want - users are obligated to have an Instagram account and log in with it (I don't use Instagram). Whenever it updates to allow for new account creations, I'll change the rating because I'll actually be able to use it then.",negative
"Extremely unresponsive. As soon as I open the application, the screen scrolling gets crazy and absolutely unreadable.",negative
"As soon as I open the app, my screen starts to flicker and freeze and the words just get overlaped of all the options I click into. It's wierd",negative
"First of all, great app. But when I try to upload gifs, it gives a weird colouring for it. Its not that clear and that is kind of annoying. Please fix it.",positive
Finally a good alternative to twitter. Looking forward to feature upgrades and tweaks to the apps but it is a great start. Can we please have a dark mode!!,positive
"I got all that glitchy screen. Duplicated text all over my screen when i scroll down or up. I really want to try this app, but i can't. Unless, it will be fixed.",negative
"absolutely love using threads. It has made connecting with friends and family so much easier and more convenient. The user interface is intuitive,I highly recommend it!",positive
Lacks:Editing features for images and videos before posting. No option to turn off video autoplay. Needs a data saver features.,positive
"Good app. What i dont like : 1. The send button when comment is in the bottom, it'll be better if its in upper right corner. 2. No dark mode 3. Hard to see if someone already follow back or not 4. Cant translate 5. Cant save photo",positive
Unable to curate your feed. Just a lot of random posts from people I don't know. Basically Instagram but with the caption above the photo instead of below.,negative
"Threads, an Instagram app is made good by Meta Social Platform. But, it doesn't needed the same copy like Twitter. You could better try a rare home page looks on the app. It's just my suggestion. Anyway, Good for posting tweets and much thanks that we could login by Instagram account.",positive
"I really didn't like the app, first of all it's not working. Lots of glitches are there..not be able to post or see any post.....and i really want to delete it without deleting my Instagram account 😭...both accounts are linked",negative
"I logged out to create a second profile, but now I cannot login or create a profile. Keep getting an error message, and then the app crashes. Please help!",positive
"Something went wrong. Please try again."" It keeps showing up after signing in with Instagram. After six hours still nothing to see what kind of app it is and what is going on there. Need your help.",positive
The application is already good but to see photos or videos that are posted/liked is still difficult. Hopefully later it can be given the feature...,negative
"Not ready for primetime yet. Can't browse media folders from within the app. Only your main camera app folder is available. For me at least, I am unable to post videos",negative
"its a new app need improvement like instagram double tap to like and all that things, option to upload or see ultra hd content, data usage controller and all other things.",positive
"love it, just want a dim mode and more privacy options (such as being visible to both your followers and people you follow or being able to mark specific posts/replies and public) so engagement is easier and safer, rather than just being cut off if you're on private.",positive
So far so good. Fast and simple UI. I hope this app can last long. Please don't end up like Twitter and Facebook. To many ads and complicated features.,positive
"The debut revealed an easy-to-use, intuitive user experience that easily integrates with Instagram. I started by searching “Threads” in the app store, scrolled through some small apps unfortunately also named Threads (RIP to those, inevitably), and clicked on Threads by Meta. The app asked me to connect my Instagram account to sign up, and I switched over from my personal to my professional page – sorry, readers, I will not be revealing my finsta here. Et voilà, I became a Threads",positive
"Really wanted to like this app, but you cannot post GIFs, yes I know about installing a GIF keyboard I've done that, and one tells me Thread cannot support an image here and a other the GIF isn't animated and a other the color is all distorted, so 1 star, won't be hanging out here much",negative
"Waiting for connection, Download will start once connection is restored- It says. Connection is fine, apart this app getting downloading rest all things which requires internet works fine. 😊. Will update the ratings, once am able to download. Done.. ok. Updated review.",positive
Pretty underwhelming experience and with quite a few bugs. Seems like a rushed release to me. FB need to be more responsible to its user base.,negative
"Overall good experience, simple. Hope they add more features soon, specially the global search, trends and ""just following"" timeline",positive
"we can't search for words bc only accs show up. the timeline is full of people i DON'T follow. no trending list. no bookmarks. please add following page where i can only see my followings' posts. OH and please make this app separate from instagram. we need to delete our ig to delete our thread acc? RIDICULOUS. if u really want to beat twitter, do all the things we say. i also tried posting a gif, but the app ruins it.pls add edit button 4 pics. we also can't save pics...? oh u'r done DONE 3/10",negative
"DO NOT SIGN UP! If you for whatever reason do not like this app, you cannot delete it without deleting your entire Instagram account. They become permanently linked. It is a total trap!",negative
"Although the app definitely has potential, the privacy policy is insane and Threads takes WAYY too much personal data. Update the privacy policy and stop monitoring browsing history, finances, and health and the app will become much more user friendly.",negative
"Great App! Reminds me of the early days of another app. ;) If you're looking for something new, it's the place to go. Love the Clean/Minimal UI. Looking forward to the future of the App.",positive
"The app is amazing, I really loved it but I am having issues change the mode of the app. It is only on dark mode on my device and I don't know how to change it back",positive
"Facing some issues such as the app eventually getting closed. Issues while writing captions, app getting closed on its own because videos are posted and so on.",positive
"Glitching, I did not set it to upload my Instagram information when it asked yet it did it on its own. All the threads I posted through the day are all gone. And I got a notification that the one thread goes against their rules, how? It's the same stuff I would post on Instagram.",negative
"Not able to share post in it using the attachment..... After the file is attached foelr the post the app get's shut down immediately...... Tried reinstalling, cleared the cache and data too but not working 🙁",negative
"THIS APP IS SMOOTH. but for now, i’ll give you 4 out of 5 stars, because we need update with the timeline. please create two timeline, first is like for you page (include all of account) timeline, and second is following (mutual only) timeline! also maybe you can add the features DM in this app! 🥺 anw i’ll give it 5 stars if we get that kind of update 🥰",positive
"Very smooth app, loving it. I keep seeing accounts I don't follow, even on Instagram on the ""Home"" page. This needs to be fixed.",positive
"An Instagram account is needed for use. What a waste of time. 🙄 I would have signed, but I don't need or want an Instagram account again. Why make it mandatory? Why not just redesign Instagram if that's the case?",negative
"This app is awesome! At one point, society had an app that had a picture of a bird, a lot of angry people, and a lot of bots. Can't remember what it was called, cause on 7/5/23 everyone uninstalled it. This app is essential for any business owner, independent contractor or influencer. The new gold standard for thread based social media!",positive
I've not created an account I just wanted to get attention with the 1 star. I was wondering if its possible to create an account without linking Instagram acc? I don't wish to share information across platform and also would like to remain anonymous on this app. Also there isn't an option to create account without agreeing to Theads terms and conditions about tailoring/sharing information. Will these be available in the future?,negative
"This app would be good if it actually let me attach media to my threads, but the paperclip icon is missing, so as an artist this app has been rendered completely useless.",negative
This was definitely needed as Instagram had become boring. Only request would be to make this app available in parallel apps so that people with more than one account have easy access and won't have to login and logout everytime,positive
Very good but there are so many bugs like when you delete a written word the whole sentence is deleted and it is a new app so it is normal that there will be bugs I hope that all the bugs are solved.,positive
"Quite nice so far, definitely a more nicer place than twitter, could perhaps add stuff like DM'S, Seeing threads that are relevant to you (like a for you page) and maybe allow the search bar to be used to search for certain threads instead of just users? Ik the app just came out but those are things I definitely would look forward to see, I've had only great experiences so far, lots of potential to be amazing. I Do think it sucks that u have to delete your insta to delete your thread account",positive
Threads is a very user-friendly app. All that I don't like is that the app doesn't manually allow you to change it to dark mode.,positive
"So far so good, but I wish I had more control over who/what topics are showing on my feeds. Also the scrolling on my phone feels slow. Let's see if it is really the ""sanely-run Twitter alternative"" as Mark said it would be.",positive
"Things that you guys should add in future update. • Theme change/Apperance • Option to edit threads • More organised notifications • Name should display in feed not username • Date and time of threads • Draft • Direct Message (DM) • GIF • Double to on image to zoom in or out • Hastag • Option to save images • Count of threads, replies and likes • Taping profile picture to expand",positive
"Not working properly, as you scroll it's UI looks scattered, it's not possible to use it for even a second.",negative
"""Login with Facebook"" is not an option? Can you imagine if Google launched a new app, allowed you to login with a YouTube account but not a Google account? No? Well, now you understand how dumb this app is. Also, not every user is going to want to be on their phone, forcing people to use an app, so you can collect more data, is shady.",negative
"It's a nice app, but is there seriously no way to see trending content? I prefer to use Twitter by going through my for you and the trending tab, as just looking through all the tweets of those im following gets boring and repetitive.",positive
"Loving the new Threads app by Instagram! I have to say, Instagram has really outdone themselves with this one. Threads is a fantastic addition to the Instagram family, and it's quickly becoming my go-to app for connecting with friends.",positive
"The feed was slick and easy to read, though for now it was populated largely with accounts I did not yet follow or care about – perhaps an issue that will resolve itself as more people sign up. ....",positive
Terrible collapses everytime I try and post a picture tried several times throughout yesterday and this morning. Reinstalled app and still doing it. Not much use to me.,negative
"The whole app becomes distorted as soon as i touch the screen after opening it. can not scroll, click anything let alone use the app.",negative
I try to install and syncronize with my ig but the launch is not smooth.. I cant refresh or change fiture in ease bcs it will sharing and the screen got shadowed.. I was like seeing a messing screen..,negative
"For first experience, the app is good. Maybe later could you please add inbox/DM feature, and section for media (pics n vids) in profile section together with thread and reply. Please add section for media so we wont need to scroll so much for pics we upload. Thanks",positive
I'm getting too much bugs in this app I'm unable to view anything on the app its too disgusting that the app is having a bug which is multipliying of the texts its like dragging the entire text multiple times,negative
I know it's a new app and updates will be made. But the app keeps closing anytime I try to comment and sometimes when I'm starting a thread. Aside that nagging issue it's a pretty great app.,positive
"This app does not render properly in dark mode/night mode. Every time i scroll the previous content is still there, and it keeps on doing that.",negative
"It's like Instagram except it's text instead of pictures, except the times you use pictures with text. Either way, it looks like Twitter. Instead of cloning somebody else's app, you should have just made your own. Social media is stagnant and Twitter sucks. Why would you think we would want another Twitter? Give us sync for Reddit comments and features mixed with Youtube, mixed with Instagram, and leave us alone. It also collects your data more than usual. Mark should pay us to use it instead",negative
So far things are normal. simple ui and faster loading. Nothing boring. Request to implement a light mode apart from Dark Mode. Loved at first sight 🤩,positive
"Better than twitter. Free from the absolute mess that it's become. Do you remember having issues with Facebook or Instagram? Me neither. I expect none to arrive with Threads either. Twitter however is currently unusable. Full of bots, spam and right wing conspiracy nutjobs.",positive
First of all I don't understand why we need another social media app. It is mixture of instgram and twitter so I don't like this app . We already have separate apps too . please stop making these kinds of apps and make better knowledgeable apps for students.,negative
I don't know how this is a possible but I'm the only review on this I feel like this app is flawed I don't really get what is going for it's supposed to be a Twitter alternative but the UI is weird you don't see who you're following on your main timeline or whatever they want to call it It only shows you followers not who you're following I can say a lot more but I'm only one person in my personal opinion I think this app is very flawed for now,negative
"the app crashes a lot and it says it has bugs , there is an issue when you try to write in arabic it is not aligned well it show many people that I don't follow them rather than i follow, please remove that , cause it's the main reason why i left twitter",negative
i think you should add features such as for you page (fyp) and following. it's a little boring scrolling and seeing random people's posts. i just hope you'll add those features because it'd be a nice experience especially for me.,negative
"Refreshing space that does not feels like is trying to force you unnecessary stuff. The way META is tackling monetization and the overall improvement over Twitter latest decisions, makes Thread a worthy replacement for the rest infamous Twitter and the trash show that has become after the new management.",positive
"Love the interface🙂, looking to explore more features. The remaining star is for the features I'm yet to explore and enjoy. How do I add other threads accounts to my main threads account, like we do on Instagram with our other Instagram accounts? And can we post from Instagram to threads at the same time like we post from Instagram to Facebook on sync at the same time? Thank you in advance for your response .",positive
"I rate this Application with only one ⭐. Because, I have no account with Instagram, so, If there is no way to Create own account with threads except with Instagram app. Many people can't use this app. Consist of me. Because, I haven't an account with Instagram app, please, brought a unique Idea.",negative
"Easy to use your instagram profile and transfer your contacts over with one click. I love the interface, it's clean clear and easy to use",positive
"Terrible experience, the whole algorithm time line is the absolute worse, i am inundated with thousands of UTTERLY MALIGNANT USELESS ASININE content from""creators"" that i could not careless if they imploded, i spend more time muting accounts than i do posting anything, i don't care about this new feed I'm being fed, i can't search for content i actually care about, this app as it is, is absolutely irrelevant, that being said the interface is straightforward and posting is easygoing. D-",negative
This application is Better than Twitter according to me😍 congratulations Mark Zuckerberg. Best wishes from my side to achieve your goals. I would like to say in this world no one can match your ideas and identity. I am very proud of you. If I will feel after using this app good really I will appreciate you. I think this app will help to some social activities and works. My knowledge is not good about this app but after using this app I am feeling a happy and positive feeling. Thanks &god bless.,positive
so far I like it. friendly user interface. similar to twitter with an instagram feel. the search page needs to be upgraded with trends tab or maybe other tabs that can make you engage more 🤷🏻‍♂️,positive
Worst experience on threads app. When I open it. It directly crashed. Fix the bugs specially for Android phones. I am using redmi note 8A. App directly crash when I just open it. Fix the bugs.,negative
"Features forthcoming. This is bare bones moreso than minimalistic, I imagine that there is more to come in terms of options and features.",positive
"Like it but, I can't post GIFs smh. I hate that new products seen to only allow certain users full access to all of the features. GIFs are almost mandatory on here to make it more entertaining lol. Why not just launch it ALL and see what happens?",negative
"I am check this application throughout and found below issue 👇👇👇 ISSUE FOUND IN THREADS APPLICATION ISSUE DESCRIPTION:- Threads bio information not updated while user update Instagram account bio and come back to the thread application and click on ""reimport"" button. Expected Result:- thread information should be updating while user click ""reimport"" button from Thread application, Integrated functionality should be working properly.",negative
"""Threads"" is a service for friends, family, and coworkers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent messages. People post can be photos, videos, links, and text. These messages are posted to your profile, sent to your followers. In one word it's ""Twitter"".",positive
"It's fast and smooth, video quality is also nice. Looking forward to the new features they ship out.",positive
"Can't use the app at all, super annoyed. The pages of the app are completely distorted I can't see a single thing!",negative
Threads provides users with a familiar interface that is easy to use. It's basically text-focused Instagram.,positive
So far so good. But still a lot of changes is needed to make it better starting from having a home feed that only shows threads from followers and not random accounts.,positive
"Becoming the first one to review this App on Playstore. The luckiest one. It is the best App ever i have used so far. How lucky I would be, if the compnay announce a reward of 10,000 USD. For me to make me the luckiest one. As a first reviewer of this App. Lets see 😘😜",positive
"Overall experience good! I got one issue - when i shared the post on ""Instagram story"" by Threads and try to click and move to Threads it's not working, it's not moving on threads page. Kindly please check that! Thanks!",positive
"Too much noise to signal. What's the point of following people if you never see their posts and only see algorithm suggested posts? Needs to be a follower based chronological feed, not a suggested non-chronological feed.",negative
"I'm gonna keep it short here. Love it!! I hope there's translation and album selection features like instagram , also a feature to hide certain threads/posts from public? 😅 Thank you. 👀🐒✨💖",positive
"Threads seems to be the reason why my Instagram has stopped working. As for threads itself, I can't see the replies I'm getting. As soon as I have IG back I'm uninstall the whole lot. The functionality is just terrible.",negative
"Just made an account and the screen glitches out immediately. Texts overlapping each other, it's a mess. Will get fixed though i believe, but will uninstall it. Wanna send a screenshot, but here is no option. F.",negative
"So far, so good, but I have a personal account and a public account, everyone I want to change between accounts takes so long and is tedious, it'll be great to add a switch account button like Instagram",positive
"Still buggy and needs more features, but it's a good start! I like that it doesn't show how many accounts you follow, so it's not about a ratio. Just follow whomever you feel like.",positive
"This app is absolute trash! Zuckerberg can go kick rocks. 🤣 This app is just another way for these elite drones to gather all your info and then control what you say and what you think. Anyone who uses this app doesn't have the mental capacity to think for themselves. It's a joke! Oh, and once you sign up, you can't delete your account unless you delete your entire Instagram account. If I could, I would rate this dumpster 🔥 0 ⭐️. 👎👎👎",negative
"The best, wow! I mean I don't write reviews but this one one is about making the first or one of the first moves to make a memory relating this app. I predict the app will outshine both insta and twitter",positive
Useless unless you have an Instagram account. Cannot see the point of this app. The fact that I cannot use the app unless I log in with an Instragram account which I don't have is just stupid.,negative
So far it's more like Twitter than Instagram. It seems like a cut down version of Instagram. With a bit of Twitter. Or the other way round. So far I have enjoyed the experience,positive
I downloaded the app it was all fine... I connected it to my insta account but as soon as I started scrolling it got hanged and smt weird was happening like the app was having some bug... Plzz fix it..,negative
"Crashes very frequently. On day 1 this wasn't a problem, but on day 2 there's a lot of crashes. Motorola G82",negative
"This app is stupid, made to rival Twitter but doesn't even stand a chance to Twitter, very buggy, a lot of glitches, and no free speech, yeah, this app has potential but not for now. Just don't waste your time downloading thread. Just use Twitter 🐦",negative
"Brings your friends on Instagram in Twitter-like format , a dedicated messenger for your Instagram. Simple and familiar interface , still needs some more features to be added.",positive
been good experience so far. room for improvement as far some features that may roll out in future. but it is not buggy or slow.,positive
I dont want the HOME page to be a cluttered mess of random people I DONT follow having conversations about things i dont care about 🤷 I only want posts from friends and people I actually follow. and I need an easy access to the list of those people. in the mean time... 1⭐️,negative
Intially it is good in threads they showing our insta followers threads also it's nice but in tweeter we have to manually follow whoever we want. But initially use it copy text always when we hold for very few seconds and it continues when we scroll down its damn irritating .. please rectify this issue team meta,positive
has potential. would love to see chronological order and the option to see posts from those you follow. atm it doesn't really matter who you follow since it's really a small chance you will even see their posts.,positive
First time use: crashed while creating a long thread with subthreads with multiple galleries and a storyline. Will revisit once they have ironed out the bugs.,negative
"This only changes the settings for…. Ready for it, Notifications. Has nothing to do with what is displayed on your wall.",negative
Extremely buggy. I can't even scroll without every screen overlapping on top of each other and creating a mess.,negative

Very bad experience as soon as I open the app it's interface starts overlapping one another and it becomes too difficult to read even a single word .. thumbs down 👎,negative
"""Your name and username are synced with Instagram and can only be changed there."" 🚮💀 So much for trying to get a name that was initially taken on Instagram at the time I signed up then.",negative
"I'm loving the app, the only fix i want apart from bug fixes is some control/filter over what we see on our feed. I don't even see the threads by people i follow, and don't wanna see random lame meme pages.",positive
I don't why I have a problem after make an account everything but when i scroll everything will be mixed and it's seems like my phone is gonna mad and i reopen the app also refresh but after some trys it still same i take a screenshot if here is an option to add i can show,negative
"Cool idea in theory, but uninstalling until I can have a home page of only accounts I follow and view posts in chronological order. That's all I want from an app like this.",negative
"I like the threads app, it's just that please improve it again with a feature to be able to find out who people don't follow us back and, as well as have a dm feature, trending stories and using hashtags. thank you, I hope you read this.",positive
I can't attach a photo. Once I selected from Galary then press ok. The app keep on crashing and just went down. Again and Again same situation. Please fix this frustrating issues.,negative
App need more time to run and not working ki various mobiles. Various glitch occurred while starting. While refreshing the app it mostly lag the application.,negative
My problem with this application is that I can only login through my Instagram account but I wanted a separate account for promoting my YT channel and I thought this would be a great opportunity. Apparently not.,negative
"Really good experience, such a calm atmosphere , slightly boring - need a feature like reels - and a DM feature - and all the people we follow on Instagram to join!",positive
So far so good. No bugs and feels better than Twitter and only time will tell how good the recommendations are as it learns. Maybe integrate the dm feature from Instagram. Also can we have a single integrated meta login?,positive
"Some problem are there the moment I log in there I thought it normal when I scroll down for the first time it was lagging like anything letters were floating , I think right now we can't use it properly but i think you guys will fix it nicely.... Thank you",positive
"I prefer this to Twitter. It works well and follows a similar structure to Instagram. I'd recommend using it, especially if you already use Instagram. This makes it really easy to make an account as you can use the same one.",positive
Well at first for me truthfully I don't like it one bit I downloaded it coz everyone around me downloaded it and I fell out of place so o dowoaded it and at first my expirence were horrible I thought we had another app like twitter and blue bird became trash so here is another but when I start using thread I am addicted coz no ads and extra money verification easy to use and your making a account is like cuttuing butter so I definitely like it and we need it,positive
"Crashes on photo upload every single time. If I attempt to upload a photo from my Fuji X-T5, the app crashes. Phone photos work fine.",positive
Very very buggy! If I try to scroll all the info on screen drags and overlays on top of each other. It's unusable,negative
"It's the same mentality !!! In face book & Instagram they just give priority in searching and suggestions to sexual profiles which attract teenagers. I think the same mentality is control Threads also. Mark Zuckerberg found his way by using the nudity to increase his Apps users. Recently, I considered Facebook and Instagram as a Sexual sotes and I thought that they may do something deferent in this new app, but it seems no deference. Twitter is my best App 👌",negative
Do liked the idea but I'm having some glitch. I can't use the app. The bug need to be fixed soon because I've seen many other have the bug too.,negative
"I've liked it so far, but if you really want this app to be like the other app, it would be nice if they gave the freedoms that the other gives to certain content or to what used to be face at the beginning XD",positive
"Pretty good launch so far, there aren't any hashtags or an explore/trends tab and you can't bookmark things or pin a post to your profile, but this is a launch of a new app so I wasn't expecting it to be perfect",positive
"My thread doesn't upload, it's showing, ""failed to upload"", and if i edit my profile, it's showing that something went wrong and not changing, fix the bugs guyss",negative
"They more features a lot more, search like in twitter, not only people, puth a banner in profiles, and separate the Instagram login, so I could make independent profiles also. And much more, but I like this design at least for now, btw too many permission ENOUGH.",negative
"Very underdeveloped, too experimental, my friends from insta just spams their already existing followers from insta in threads with pointless rambling nonsense, it's like 2008 Twitter but worse. Search function is only applicable for accounts, no real way to search public posts. No dark mode theme.",negative
love it and hate it so much at the same time coz we can't just go into gallery from threads suppose i wnat to pin a pic in someones thread i select pin and it just shows all pics from recent we have no option to select from gallery like in other apps we just have to keep scrolling 10000 of pics till we find the pic to pin in....plz let us open gallery our gallery from threads....its really annoying....,negative
"I think it broke my insta when I installed it, my backgrounds on insta aren't working anymore, also my friend the app just crashes when they try to post anything, it's also kinda just boring",negative
"The app works great. I love this experience, but I just updated my password on Instagram and now I can't get back into Threads. Please fix. Thank you.",positive
"This aps is handy and pretty friendly. If you allowed users to edit and add specific songs to their threads , it would be perfect.",positive
A bunch of people I don't follow show in my feed for no reason. So far it's useless spam app with no real purpose. Cannot easily switch between multiple accounts. Nice dark mode though.,negative
Showstopper that you can not limit your feed to only those you follow forcing you to wade through all sorts of garbage. Back to the Tw original for now . Can't believe they launched without this,negative
"You need to delete your Instagram account and now, it's getting glitchy and starting to slow down cause of the app, instead of doing it sperately so everyone can enjoy. This is another failure by Mark Zuckerberg. Elon Musk won the cage match. Twitter can't be replaced.",negative
"Would like to see the repost changed to rethread, then would like to see more content of the people I follow rather than more suggestions, the app is huge and very easy to use, big ups Zuckerberg and the team.",positive
Trying to create an account but when I get to the date of birth page I have to step through every month back to the month I was born in. That would be 800+ taps. Not going to happen!!,negative
"The plateform looks nice. But as a Threads newbie, I don't expect to see posts from those whom I don't choose to follow. There're too much feeds. Strongly suggest @Meta to limit this unwanted data overload.",positive
"It's glitching a lot. Resolve this issue. There's some problem with the background, and else everything is good.",negative
"Things that should be implemented: - Trending topics - Profiles background image - A ""seek"" button that allows you to see reposts that were made of profiles you blocked. When someone resposts now, it only appears ""this content is not available"" - Search for content, so you can find other people posts - Also a Tab to see the posts you liked",positive
"It's like best part of Twitter and Instagram and has , remarkably, a lot of amazing features (considering it's a newly launched app ) . I would like a way to bookmark threads though",positive
"This app is good but i hope in the next update they add something that we can put back the ""thread badge"" on our Instagram profile, i removed the badge and realized its much easier for my friends to track my thread. Plsss add it so ppl can also decide to remove or put it back huhu",positive
"It's crashing pretty hard, can't scroll at all and can't make a thread or anything, it just crashes and has a ton of visual bugs",negative
"Too common app name, lack of uniqueness. There is no option to turn of auto play video. No translate option for other language threads. Lack of creativity, same old app",negative
"It has a bug where pages overlap, which renders it unusable. Not everyone is experiencing the bug tho.",negative
Crashes when I try to upload photos. Haven't been able to share a single image yet. Will change rating if fixed.,negative
"Well this was my first day & I'm enjoying this app but still I think there must be some interesting features need to be added like messages, following list at the top, comments rather than replies etc . . . Good effort ✔️",positive
very slow and hanging always. could have been better. but having intial launch app it should be better launch with mote adoption and smooth. and not hanging. already disappointed .,negative
The app keeps on glitching every time I open it. Even after uninstalling the app and installing it again. Honestly I don't know what to do... Any advice....,negative
"So far so good, there are certain things I think would be a great help for the users like translations, archive etc. I hope for the app's growth with the growing community.",positive
"I just got the app, and it's already crashing every time I'm in it for 20 seconds. I cleared the cache, but I got a message that there's a bug. Please fix it, thank you.",negative
"Unfortunately my experience is pretty bad. App lags and is unusable. I would post screenshots here to make it clear what's wrong,but there's no such option:(",negative
Worked fine for the first two days and then suddenly I can't seem to make any kind of post on the evening of the third day. It keeps posting (uploading) foever.,negative
"Definitely needs work, lacks some basic features like dms, being able to sort the timeline between for you and following. Right now the timeline is full of checkmarks nobody gives a damn about so scrolling the news feed is like sandpaper to my brain.",negative
"Instagram Threads is a solid new app that offers a unique way to connect with your followers. It's easy to use and integrates seamlessly with Instagram, making it a great option for people who want to share more text-based content with their audience.",positive
"Great UI, nice feel. One thing tho is I think we should be able to zoom in on pics and it stays still when we release it.",positive
App is crashing a lot and refresh is also taking a lot of time. There is no options to insert gif in the replies.,negative
"very clean and simple UI, the timeline is not attractive for long time use: i'd like to have a timeline where i can just see the threads of those i follow. maybe have two timelines?",positive
"Since I'm not on Instagram, does it mean I can't have a Thread account??Would have been better had it not been a prerequisite....I'm not intending to join Instagram. Make registration through FB accounts an option.",negative
everything is perfect. i cannot complain at all but the app keeps crashing after a while it becomes annoying and agitating,positive
Complete disaster. On top of that it doesn't let you take it off of your phone because IG might go too. Doesn't let me upload some pictures and I sent notification 2 times and nothing.,negative
"full of fake scam profiles, can't select who or what you see on feed. Spend most of the time scrolling and blocking irrelevant profiles/content. Algorithms and ML needed.",negative
"Too much of the posts that you don't need to see appearing, no way to control it. Too much unecessary and sus data collection as per Data Safety section.",negative
"Horribly this app requires you to also have an Instagram account. Years ago, I made a wonderful decision to deactivate Instagram and while I was initially keen to try Threads, this is a instant stop sign for me.",negative
"Very2 simple, and i love the clean look!!! I know this app need to add more features but pls pls pls pls make it simple and not messy like Facebook & Instagram? Pls hear what users want.. Instagram algorithms sucks, so far i love this one.",positive
So far it's been messy. No option to set the feed to only accounts you follow is a massive turn off. If that isn't updated soon you can expect this to flop like the rest of the twitter replacements,negative
"After logged into this app , thread ID shown in insta , by mistake I hide that ID but now I'm not able to unhide that , not able to find an option to revert that changes. If possible please enable that otpion OR provide the path for the same !",positive
Utter garbage! It doesn't have sign up feature. It lacks 99% of the feature twitter has. It is a bad Instagram alternative.,negative
Works on algorithms. It is showing me threads from non follwed accounts as well on my feeds and making it really mess. That I'm seeing randomly from anyone and not specifically followed users.,negative
Please remove the option of posting videos. I highly recommend! Then there will be no difference in threads and Instagram. We don't want to see reels flooded. I highly request.,negative
When I open this app in my mobile after filling the specified details .the total frame and letters are in jumping from up to down.so by this glitch I can't able to use this app.plzz resolve this problem as soon as possible.,negative
"Excellent App. I was since long looking for Text based social networking by instagram 😇😘😍 For the sake of Feedback, I miss the hashtag option of Instagram. And the app size needs to be smaller. But still I love Facebook, I love Instagram, I love Mark Zuckerberg... nobody knows the art of Social Networking like Mark Zuckerberg knows...!!!",positive
Best app to share thoughts and feelings when uhh are bored while watching reels n all. It's like Twitter but on the same time it's different from Twitter. Over-all Nice experience and must try once.,positive
The app is too buggy.. maybe because millions of people are using it right now and it crashed. Now I keep deleting and installing again. Anyone experiencing the same?,negative
"Very impersonal feeling UI, in it's current state this app feels more like a barebones Instagram copy rather than an extension of it.",negative
It merges the aesthetics of Instagram and the functionalities essential and more than enough for microblogging. It's a match made in heaven.,positive
Can't post photos or videos as the app will stop working. Can't see any posts from accounts I follow even though I adjusted my notifications. Can only see accounts I don't follow on home page.,negative
"The app is good enough, but I'm facing some challenges whenever I want to post a picture, the app keeps on closing itself.",positive
"I hope there will be an update and improvement, such as creating a dark theme. I really hoping for this dark theme, even it's not important lol. However, so far I really love this app compared to Twitter. Thanks Meta.",positive
"This is an amazing app, I just hope you can Add EDIT OPTION so we would still have the chance to edit some parts if there is any grammatical errors or typos.",positive
Disappointing. I dumped Twitter when Musk took over. Wanted to join Threads but because I don't have an Instagram account I can't sign into the app. Deleting it shortly. Sigh! Truly disappointing. 😔,negative
"I'm very dissapointed, but I hope this is because this app is very new. I'd like to not see posts of people I do not follow at all, and only in English, it's annoying to come across my native language when I don't want to.",negative
"Honestly, one of the smoothest launches of a new social media ever? Really impressed so far. The brilliance is in the simplicity and easy community building.",positive
"It works much better, than other sites, such as twitter, facebook.... It is really interesting websites, what I ever seen, because there you can make your ,,foryou,, what you like and what you are interested in.",positive
"Not even 5 minutes in, it crashed. I put in my Instagram account information and everything was fine until I tried to scroll it glitched. Please fix this problem, Thank you",negative
There is millions of bugs and glitches 😑 I've installed and uninstalled. i can't verify my Instagram account they sent verification code over phone call that was 6 digits number but Threads ask 8 digits to verify my account. Where is my another 2 digits of verification codes?? 😅,negative
Ok to start. now it's constantly crashing whenever I am trying to write a post. Fix! Still crashing every time I try to write a post. WTH!!,negative
"It's not working at all it's completely broken, when I scroll the text lines up like a windows error bar in a PC. The app is completely broken dude",negative
Only one suggestion is that it would be much better if you add option to save photos to gallery from random post.,positive
"Please I need my Instagram back, I just unstalled thread app due to insufficient space in my phone and automatically my Instagram is not longer opening. I have to delete another app in my phone just to install thread again for my Instagram to be restore. Please mark work on this issue.",negative
One of the best design social platform. Make it more easy and useful don't added too much stuff to make it boring. It's just awesome the way it is right now.,positive
Really bad experience. It is full of bugs and the screen freezes everytime I open the app.,negative
"A lot to fix, the feed is like Instagram which only shows algorithm instead of the last post, it shows more influencer people I don't care than the actually accounts I followed, the dark theme by default is cool.",negative
"Awsome, a total rip off of Twitter, but cool, but the keyboard seems to do crazy stuff when typing on the posts. Typing special characters and changing the start of it. Seems like you are tracking the thread before it even posted?",positive
I am encountering a significant issue when I launch the application. The scrolling animations in the app are not working properly.,negative
"There is nothing new in this application. If you want it to continue, make new updates to the application, because the first day of using sentences with two dimensions is very normal and boring.",negative
Kindly make a mature UI. UX is not good. I think you should think of it again. This doesn't seem mature. Its like new coder have put all the components at one place.,negative
"Great UI/UX design and simple interface, please add hashtag and trending feature and also try to add something from which user can gain more followers.",positive
"I don't have a problem with it so far except for not being able to translate yet, to me it's a Twitter but without the random nudes😁 I recommend, Twitter is getting old anyways, this is the Gen Z version maybe? 🤷‍♀️",positive
Everytime I download it glitches happen and everything overlaps. I've deleted and downloaded it several times hoping it would work but it didn't....,negative
"Just another app that Meta uses to shove ads, influencers, and top brands down the throats of everyone. I go on the app to see what the accounts I follow have posted, only to get swamped with posts from the likes of the idiot Kardashians, and other brands that I do not follow nor like. It's excruciatingly annoying.",negative
I really like this app! It's wonderful! I'm just kind of sad ever sense I downloaded threads I got a bug on the instagram app and now it crashes everytime I try to pull up the app🥲,positive
"With the death of twitter wanted to try an alternative, however.. There is no way to create an acount in the app. Exclusively for existing Instagram users. There isn't even a mechanism to create a new instagram account.",negative
"Nice one a formidable rival to twitter. But i think more should be done to sarnitize the app, contents are just allover the place. Getting contents from people i dont follow kinda makes me feel weary. But overall i love the app",positive
"Has the potential to knock Twitter out of the water, but until I can just see the content of who I follow, it's not usable. That time line is so chaotic it's not fun to read. Why have a follow function if you still see people you do not follow?",negative
"I dont know if its just my phone of your app, whenever i try to scroll down it will break like all the threads are mixed up going up and down, only the images are visible, so sad.",negative
"Very annoying that it's pushing a bunch of other accounts. If wanted to see what certain influencers, celebrities or brands were saying I would follow them. Maybe have a trending tab or something else but for general scrolling I'd rather seen only who I follow!",negative
Really good app.. Hopefully it doesn't die out soon.. The upload resolution quality for pics and videos are top tier.. Better than any of the other apps that would kill the quality.. Good job Zuck 👍🏽..,positive
App Is Crash Now And First Position is static then scroll down screen about all fiction are not working and is confusing. Please Check Out Now This Bug or Error. How To Send Screen Shot ?,negative
"Hey! I got a bug. After installing Threads whenever I open Threads, my Instagram DM theme sets back to Default even if I change the theme and open Thread again, it changes my Instagram DM theme back to Default again. Please kindly resolve this bug on priority.",negative
"The worst of Twitter. It's turned into just the awful For You thread with random shite from random times copy of Twitter with no option just to get stuff from people you actually follow. Gets worse every day as more randoms join, and after 3 days already just annoying.",negative
"Just downloaded it, have an Instagram that I barely ever use....opened up threads and it's just randoml blue check marks of people who don't interest me at all. It's pure chaos, fix it or just delete it",negative
"Bug on Redmi 6. Screen glitching when doing something on the app (scrolling timeline, switch tab, and other activites that makes move on the screen)",negative
"It's literally completely broken. You synced my Instagram bio when I said not to. App doesn't load anything. You changed my profile, and now I can't change it back. Fix your app",negative
"The app is glitchy. The interface is shaking. Can't read what's on the screen. It's a bug, needs to fix it.",negative
"I'd suggest making atleast our name changable (idk why, just a random suggestion) and also add a show/hide option for showing/hiding Instagram and Thread accounts, but either way, this is a good app which is way better than Twitter.",positive
These are many times better Twitter apps than yours. I will try my best to use Twitter every day. Don't use this and this is a nonsense feature that if we delete this account it will delete our Instagram account as well. I want to tell everyone one thing that this is very nonsense but please don't use it. 💯🙏🏻,negative
When i scroll the screen the app will blur and something like glitch effect the font and the image not showing.. I have screenshot but there is not any option to upload please give ur email id there i will send screenshot of error in threads app,negative
"I installed this thread app 2 or 3 times but still it is getting fully glitched if it was pbm of my phone thn whatsApp, insta all shld have got glitched. Didn't like this app . Sorry.. But i appreciate the hard work u ppl have put to make this application.",negative
"Its a good app though i wish it was just an added feature on Instagram app so i dont have to install another app. Also, I hope you give us an option to delete our threads profile without affecting our instagram main profile 🫶",positive
"I have high hopes and a very low bar set by... you know. Thus far, impressed by ease of installation and clean interface. Chose to set up clean slate account which I'd recommend until you're sure this is a good add for your ""main"" IG footprint",positive
"Dear founder of Thread Apps. So far I like the look of this app because it's a bit like a *blue bird one.* But, I'm not really satisfied by this apps because there's no pinned thread, i wanna pin something on my profile, so people who's want to follow me know about my account. My advice, please add the pinned thread feature, so it will make it easier for people to find out about my account or my personal backstory. Thank you so much for reading my review, i hope it reaches you.",positive
"The best social media app! It feels so smooth! This is a combination of facebook and instagram, a lighter, smoother and no limitations!",positive
"Fluidity of the App is best. It is really stable as if it can easily sync with other META apps like Instagram, Facebook. Just love the new atmosphere of this new social media app. Welcome to the competition! 😜",positive
Just alright...needs much improvement...I'm seeing alotta thread accts showing up on my feed that I don't follow...seems like the random accts show up when an acct I am following responds to their post or vice versa...would like that to change...might delete since this is a nuisance..,negative
"It's really good. Can you fix the problem where I want to change the bio or profile? It keeps saying something went wrong. Also, can you add a switch account or create a new profile?",positive
What a mess. I only want to see people I follow. I don't care what the other nuffies are up to. You hide the feature in Instagram and on Threads it isn't even an option. Another garbage app from out of touch devs.,negative
Is it just me or when i use this app and move the screen the frames multiply and the whole screen gets covered with the frames? I cant even read anything. If this is a bug pleas fix it or is it my phone?,negative
"Not measuring up to twitter. The search function doesn't shop threads content, only people . My main way of using twitter was to find out what was going on or what people were talking about in real time and join the conversation... but app does not allow this.",negative
It was a lovely experience of using this app. I really like the user interface and features of it.This is a great platform of sharing your conversation.,positive
Good app . However on thing we request is to have the translation there. Not all of us read a particular language . If have I will change mine to at least a four star for now,negative
my experience Yay I really liked the tutor and I am getting a lot of help here to cheat and very good this platform and I am sure it will be better than a best perform tutor. Would like to,positive
This app is amazing and I've been addicted to it from the start but some changes I would like to see are a following page (I'll update if there's anything else) but I would 100% recommend this app,positive
Really good alternative to similar apps. Very clean and nice UI. Really responsive and well connected to Instagram.,positive
"Useless. Basically, it's just Instagram. It's makes no sense. Since it's by Instagram, why can't followers carry on to this? Why do I have to start getting followers from scratch when the app is connected to Instagram? Like I said, it's useless. I deactivated and uninstalled the app.",negative
"Worst glitch is happening here, can't even explain the type of glitch, but the contents of the screen get cloned everytime I scroll through the app, at first I thought it was my phone but it's glitch in the app itself...",negative
"I can't open profile picture of others, so i think Twitter is still better, and the UI not perfect, Twitter still better, fix the profile picture and the user interface, and unblock Andrew tate from Instagram so i can use threads",negative
My experience with thread app is so bad the app is constantly crashing you can't even get a hold of your own feed ... I didn't even got the chance to discover the app,negative
"i havent had any probs except when im using the delete keys to delete my typos, but the other words gets rejoined together and its really annoying.. hope yall could fix that..and for sure i would live to give yall a 5* !!",negative
"Good overall experience so far, though it would be nice if there a save button for images so we can save them directly",positive
"Super great, able to speak the way I wanted, interface is simple and great, hopefully ads will not ruin the experience",positive
"Amazing Ads free experience and pure content at full scale. This is what we need. There should be different types of tick for verification of users. Private user, Normal user, content creator and Pro User.",positive
Cool so far..2 features I think might separate it from others 1. Like and Dislike button 2. Either a DM for privacy or a locked view message to be seen by only the person you are replying to and yourself...,positive
ehhh I would prefer if Threads was a bit separate from IG. keep it separate ie. ig private & threads public and to have the ability to change user name in Threads if possible. I prefer not to be connected-linked to IG all of it.,negative
"This is not a high quality app. In this, the post of useless people comes to your home without calling you, picture editing facility is also not available in this.",negative
"Minor bug in the activity menu where you can't scroll down ""all section""everything else is. It's a very demanding app. However, its still needs some improvement",positive
It's familiar to Twitter where the difference! But it made an ecosystem with Instagram and that's pretty good 👍 I'm searching for a differentiation to use thread.,positive
"👉Bio for Threads/Threads Bio ideas: Hey there, fam! Have you heard about the Threads app?  It’s Instagram’s super cool text-based conversation app that’s all the rage right now! Get ready to take your chatting game to the next level with this application. Instagram, is the greatest platform where billions of individuals from all corners of the globe come together to connect, share, and inspire through attracting photos and videos.  Threads!  is like Instagram but for text! Can you believe it?🥰",positive
"Downloaded this app but I guess you can't open this app unless you have an Instagram account, which I don't & don't want. The app will not go past that page, so there is no way to open an account!??",negative
"I love threads, but I'd love more navigation (I'm sure it's being developed). Also, today it crashes when I open comments on any post, just a heads up to developers :)",positive
"The app is great. However, after a successful installation and it logging in, Instagram app crashes frequently.",negative
Great app. Would have given a 5 star but my post keeps failing to upload for 2 days now. Pls fix or drop the android upgrade cos I see ios users talking about the new upgrade that comes with translation and other cool stuff,positive
"It's really a good app, but we need button for translation and pause menu on videos, or videos shouldn't be played automatically",positive
"The screen is unreadable. Seriously disappointed. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still won't work.",negative
ANOTHER GARBAGE FROM META - A copycat app which is launched to compete with Tweeter but it pales in comparison to this app & moreover it is confusing wether it is a stand-alone app or part of Instagram because while logging you have to go through the hassle of logging through this app,negative
App still need work. The screen freezes when I scroll through the app and it looks like a million popup is on my screen,negative
"First two days it was Ok, the third day,Screen acted wierdly as I opened the app. I thought its my Phone's display fault at first. And Another problem is that I am unable to switch accounts instantly just like we do in Instagram.",negative
"You guys still impose the annoying auto play video on this app just like Instagram, the reason I don't use Instagram, how can you not give us option to turn off the feature? So annoying.",negative
"Very good app, this app is integrated directly with Instagram so it makes it very easy for me. The UI is also very simple and easy to use. I haven't found any bugs so far, so I give 5 out 5 👍",positive
"Very poor. My feed is full of rubbish, not from the people I follow. I can't even turn the dross off in the settings. No chance of replacing Twitter in this state 🥱",negative
Not a serious Twitter competitor. Feed is littered with content that I don't follow and is not in chronological order. It's the worst of Facebook trying to imitate Twitter without actually incorporating the best part about Twitter,negative
"Twitter is WAY better! If you don't want to be told what to think and you value your right to have an open, free and civilized dialog, then use the app that supports and encourages it!",negative
"As a developer and a normal user, the app is really easy to navigate through and also has a simple ui.",positive
"Amazing app. Still need more features to take people off Twitter. Need to stand alone from Instagram, shouldn't be limited to users of Instagram. I don't like Instagram so much but I love the thread.",positive
It's not working in my phone. When I open this app login page appears when in put my email and password for logging in the screen goes blurry.,negative
Would've been fine except the forced algorithmic timeline (which basically shows the follows of your follows and none of your own follows) basically ruins the entire app,negative
"Threads by Instagram is the ultimate mashup of Twitter and Instagram, delivering a captivating microblogging experience with an Insta-worthy twist. It's like having the best of both worlds in one slick app. Prepare for your social life to take off!",positive
I found a major bug where it shows white screen 1. Installed the application 2. Switch to different instagram account and click back button without filling any details then it shows white screen Please let me know where to file this?,negative
"Good clean ui, keeps crashing when attaching pictures or videos. Missing function to privately message someone can be added later",positive
The app is great amazing well optimitized and very well running but I would like to see other features added such as dms and views on your threads if they do that it would overtake twitter in a matter of days otherwise great app,positive
"I love it. But it needs more work, more features, and adjustments to show current threads and not stuff from the previous day.",positive
Really enjoying this app so far. I do hope there are plans to make it so we can log in to multiple accounts and also a web app as well but apart from that so far so good for me.,positive
"Reposted a post and when they deleted it, the post went to “Content not available”. The post should've disappeared and not left a mark! It's making my profile look ugly. It's irritating.",negative
"You should make this app available for Iphones worldwide as well, and make sure you add the switch account option just like in instagram to make it easier to manage two accounts at the same time.",negative
This app is cool but one quick bug on android is the attachment. It quits everytime I try to attach an image/images to a thread.,negative
Pretty much excellent start but I wish there was a minor option to just view the threads from users I'm following instead of everybody. Also there is no current way to search for a particular threads.,positive
It's all in a language I cannot understand and changing it has not been easy. Just seems like a copy of twitter just not as good. Why would anyone need this when we already have twitter? Why do we need so many social media apps???,negative
Please separate timeline by two categories which are FYP and following only (with some filters like show latest thread or show trending). Add a Direct Messages too so people can feel more connected each other. The last thing is create a mark on people who following each other so we can track someone who doesn't follow back or someone who just unfollowed us. Thanks.,positive
Absolutely pathetic experience. It keeps crashing. Im using Android phone and it seems that the app is not programmed for it,negative
"No longer working. Can't post or read replies on other threads. I've reinstalled, updated, logged in and out, reported it. Still not working.",negative
App crashes whenever I try to upload a picture. Tried reinstalling and it did not work. App is installed on Samsung S23 Ultra.,negative
"Useless app. Once signed in, you can't delete your account without deleting your Instagram too! I believe we should have been informed about it in advance",negative
"Unusable. The app full of glitches, it's impossible to read even one post. Only posted photos are visible.",negative
"lots of potential, needs work. crashes every time i try to attach a picture to a post.",negative
"Needs a lot of work. Why must I view rando's threads? What is the point of following people if I can't view their threads FIRST? Right now, it is WORSE than Twitter! Why is it so hard to switch accounts? IG and FB make it easy to switch, without having to approve a new login request!",negative
"No hashtags or ability to search for a particular discussion. Can only see content from people you follow or that gets ""randomly"" recommended. Does not compete as a Twitter replacement, yet.",negative
Works as you'd expect. Haven't experienced any glitches or outages. Easy to use and navigate the app. Enjoy seeing content.,positive
"Can't delete threads account without deleting Instagram! Why does it need so many permissions that don't seem at all necessary? It's literally a copy of Twitter but with more censorship, tracking, and creepy personalized ads.",negative
"Won't let me follow anyone, 8 days now and the response from Threadsapp team non-existent. Other than that, i like the communuty and the app is getting better, but has a long way to go.",negative
"Be Advised!! I looked into deleting my Threads account and found this in the Help Section: ""Since Threads is powered by Instagram, in order to delete your Threads profile and data, you will have to delete your Instagram account. Note that we're looking into a way to delete your Threads profile separately. This app is incredibly boring. No way comparable to Twitter.",negative
"Force closes when I try and post photos. Whether it's a photo I'm posting, or if I'm replying with photos... I'm sure it's just opening day glitches, but booooooo.",negative
"not a single person I follow shows up on my timeline, just 3rd rate influencers. no option to see only those I follow? also when replying, I can't see my own prompt, the keyboard covers it...",negative
"It has been synchronized with the Instagram ID, which is very struggling process. I don't know those who don't have insta id, how they sign in to the app...?",negative
Amazing App... It's a best competitor for Twitter... But needs some improvements and I think you can add some earning methods also in this app for making it unique and different from Twitter.,positive
The only problem I have with this app is you can't choose your username it automatically takes it from your Instagram. I feel like I was early enough to this app where I could finally get the username that I have on YouTube. Or even a username for my band. But I can't because Instagram....,positive
App keeps crashing.. won't let me upload photo's also it would be cool if this app allowed private direct messages just like Instagram... hopefully that comes soon too.,negative
"Just as the rumors said, it's a blatant Twitter ripoff. Absolutely nothing compelling to the interface or the platform. Everything feels very plain and like a stripped dumbed-down version of Twitter, making me feel like I'd rather just use it instead. If they wanted to make a splash and compete with Daddy Musk, they're failing quite miserably right now. Should've fully polished things up before releasing this half-baked uninspired mess.",negative
"Twitstagram! The Twitter UI is a bit nicer to use, but Threads is very active and there are no limits! Looking forward to the next few months of development",positive
"This app is not enough. I didn't like it. Because if we log in this app we will be stuck. If you log out from this, you will be logged out from Instagram. You should find a solution for this as soon as possible.",negative
"It's okeh but bruv, if u wanna compleat add story & ig music with reels too, Incld adding hash tags & music to photos, it would work so much better like fr, don't have any other problems tho, also messaging people too yk, Cos it's kinda hard to use ngl.",positive
"Obnoxious home page/feed. It's basically irrelevant to follow people on this app as the feed shows you content based on ""the algorithm"" not people you choose to follow.",negative
I wanted to check it out but nevermind. The only login option is with an instagram account. I don't want Instagram and will not create an account just for that.,negative
"Nice app ,but less than Twitter 🙄, let's more improve the app ,team Instagram, only add photo not musics, songs.please improve the bug yaar ... Great app for text but add music .....team @meta,@instagram 😕 thanks..... 👍",positive
"This app is perfect as it is now please don't add ads or allow bots on this platform, and a final suggestion would be to not add dms in this app since Instagram already has that feature so just keep this app focused more on the threading!",positive
When I logged in to the app it showed me a huge bug . The company of the app is need to be solve the problem neither it will be going a huge trouble for the users. Really very disappointing.,negative
Great app and I know Mosseri admits that some functionality is missing but I'd really like to bookmark or save threads that are really interesting just like you can on Twitter.,positive
"I would really like to be able to use more than one account. I have 2 IG accounts, 1 business and 1 personal, but can only use one on the app on my phone by just switching like on the IG app.",positive
It is really nice that we have got a media platform of our own expectations 📌 it is a nice app where u express your self and have fun at the same time. All I can say is that it is the best platform I have ever seen. Everyone should join,positive
I am experiencing a blurry display of this App and i cant read the writings and cant see the images. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app thrice but still its not working,negative
Very cool and easy to use. Also love that they don't allow lies and hate with a strong fact checking and moderation system in place.,positive
"Unable to login because i login every time on Instagram with my Facebook account, i didnt made any id seperately, however i am unable to login through insta when i try to login it is asking about the password of Instagram, now the thing is my password is the same as my Facebook id, when i enter it it is showing as incorrect.",negative
Amazing app...and I like it more than twitter...and I hope it can easily defeat twitter...if meaningless policies will no t be made... And the feature...that we can type/write more context in 1 thread as compared to twitter ...which are less... @zuck 👌🏼,positive
"Very vest of time application, worst experience, copy of Twitter, threads is a Twitter little brother, I deleted threads and all so Instagram, and Instagram like a tik tok 2.0 version, and really rate of both app 100/-1 they are deserving this rate.",negative
"Twitter was going to the dogs, so I left, this came along, I liked it's ease of use, it isn't a slanging match, I had no high expectations and it's exceeded them easily.",positive
😡😡😡😡😡It's been 10 days and i can not post my 64 mega pixels photo's in any way possible it's just soooo disappointing to say that i might regret my choice over Twitter 😡😡😡😡😡 02/10 . It's my 2 dayI hope I can save the picture too just like in Twitter which will make me delete the Twitter app for sure meta please give some thought to my review I hope you guys will understand 🤍 over all i love to use this threads app ☺️ 9.8/10,negative
"Better than Twitter. Good interface but dark mode, data saver etc features should be added in it. 👍👍👍",positive
"Need some more features like DM's and a NSFW system so people can enjoy it most. Also, a way to seperate reccomend threads and threads from following. Other than that it's good.",positive
"Once I open the app, it starts glitching. I have installed and unistalled 3 times now. I can't even scroll the TimeLine or go to profile.",negative
My experience was worst I didn't even wanna give 1 star because whenever I open it there are so many glitchs and we click one thing but we see it's multiple selfs and it's running automatically,negative
"Occasional a particular picture won't load or the sound won't play in a certain video, but for the most part... All good",positive
"Why am I facing glitching issues every time I open the app, i tried uninstalling the app and then reinstalling,then also it didn't work, all i could see was an entire screen full of glitches",negative
"Even if it looks the same as Twitter, it's really fun and enjoyable and i'm glad there are no bugs, glitches, lags and other problems on this app. Good Job!",positive
Hope there's an easier option to switch account like in Instagram. Crashes every time I do it.,negative
The feed algorithm is hell on earth. No features. Pointless and will die in a few months. Was really hoping it would be good and save us from Elon,negative
Too good liked the AI and UI of the app 💯 Instagram connection is a great way to enhance the use of both apps. Great reach with least marketing. Happy threading.,positive
6Jul23-The only way to get in is to log-in with instagram and I DON'T HAVE instagram. I haven't had it in well over a year and don't want it again. I'll just classify this as another useless app...,negative
I wanted to love it. I was hoping it would be a twitter killer. But it's just Facebook 2.0. My entire feed are people I don't follow. I actually struggle to find the posts from those who I do follow. It's about 1 in 20 threads that are people I want to hear from. It's just a mess.,negative
"it's good, but, no setting to turn off video autoplay(I really hate this), no option to save a photo, I really hope that threads will just like a twitter, but with no elon on it...",negative
"Nice social app by Instagram ❤️ , I really liked the simplicity of the app UI and the basic features . Hoping for the new features to drop by soon 🤞.",positive
"Need to improve algorithm. What makes twitter interesting is their homepage can show the most random yet funny tweets from ANYONE. In threads I only saw influencer or celebrity who ""trying"" to be funny but ending up cringe.",positive
"This is frustrating, threads? Why can't upload or find explicit contents here. Hopefully you'll consider openning for explicit contents, otherwise this app is lame. Make this app where users can upload any contents they like. ;will go back to twitter.",negative
"Its fantastic platform for shearing your ideas, thoughts & opinion socially ! In their all functionalities & performance is also best & also it's very easy and userfriendly for use....!!",positive
"Giving it 4 stars cuz of few reasons. 1 we can't do hashtags. 2 We can't stitch accounts, only we can use one account, and for switching we have to logout and then login another account. 3 it can't show insights of the threads/posts.",positive
"Cool concept, but not nearly complete enough to even compete with Twitter. It needs some time before it can truly compete with Twitter.",negative
"Lacks plenty of features, you can follow acclunts in discovery only and your feed has only 1 option which is all random, no other features",negative
"honestly this app ui is very phenomenal, but the algorithm is not right... nothing but verified people in the feed, no good opportunities for smaller people to actually grow on to a platform its just awful i might actually deal with Twitter.",negative
Basically just shows a bunch of brands social media managers trying to be quirky. Too much time spent using the mute button to not even curate a desired feed.,negative
"It's great app ,but alot need to be done in terms of futures of saving pictures ,and alot more .,thanks to meta family ,Am apart you since 2014 on Facebook .",negative
I would like to love this app but it doesn't seem to let me add pictures to my quotes. It stops the app and takes me out all together. Am I the only one? I hope they can fix this problem soon 🥺,negative
"When i upload the attached media (picture) with the selection from gallery use the share button, when the threads's page appear, the picture i selected doing image rotation by itself. What happens?",negative
"Good potential and nice to not have to constantly be reminded of elons existence, albeit the app is still pretty new so there's still some features in the works but overall I see the potential",positive
Not worth switching from other social media. File upload is a fail and the setup is a disaster. I will change my review if you make this app usable.,negative
"A stupid copy of Twitter.. Like the rest of the meta thefts in the testicle of Rails that failed in Instagram, think of something other than imitation. This is the reason for Twitter's success. It is distinguished from the rest, and it is better than Insta and Facebook.",negative
"Since I downloaded threads, my instagram app has been crashing. I had to finally uninstall both. Tried installing Instagram again and it has been crashing. Support please help.",negative
Threads app keep crashing all the time . I reinstalled the app but didn't work out . Pls remove this crashing or buzzing whatever it is.,negative
I've been trying to open this app since last 30 minutes but it's still showing me errors and not letting me login my account and it's telling me to wait for a moment. Idk what to do.,negative
This app is mass or nothing whenever I open this app is acting like weird first time I think it's just my phone problem but not my brother has iphone and in his is also this app acting weird when I scroll any thing this seem load anything on screen could you plz fix this type bugs I really need to explore this app do some thing,negative
"Very poor, working for 24 hrs then everything was ""something went wrong"" can see nothing but the main feed. You can only see what Threads wants you to see. Potential but right now bit of a train crash.",negative
"Poor, buggy twitter copy but worse than twitter, linked to Instagram account and can't use without one, so will be removed after 10 mins, I'm guessing it's just another way for big tech to steal, sell our data bye bye",negative
The experience is awesome but it would be great to be able to translate certain posts to our respective languages to understand just like on Instagram,positive
DONT INSTALL! ACCOUNT CANT BE DELETED ONCE ITS CREATED!! The account gets permanently linked to your Instagram account and you can't delete one without having to delete the other.,negative
"I know y'all can fix this, but it's not letting me upload right now. Whenever I tap the attach button, my app crashes. Please fix to update my score.",negative
Their is an only one option for login that is Instagram but their is many Facebook user can also try this app and i think that most of facebook user are older there is and some probability they don't have an insta ac if we provide the login with Facebook then uts help.. (We can not avoid some minorities may be this can help us in future),positive
"Good interface Nice design Looks like twitter. Cross of insta and twitter But lacks some features of twitter like Translations under threads, don't have trending page like twitter, Don't have short videos like in twitter, Don't have view button like on twitter which shows how many saw your tweets. Don't show features like retweets, quotes tweets, have in twitter.",positive
"In desperate need of gifs, hashtags, and trending tabs. Already better content than Twitter, and without the racism too. I just wish it would show me more of the content from accounts I follow than random accounts I don't. Solid start though, will only improve from here as new features are added. 👌",positive
"App is generic, took a long time to install. Requires Instagram, nothing but Instagram without pictures. Don't waste your time, just another app.",negative
Display rendering issue where text overlays on top of everything when scrolling or opening menu makes app completely unsustainable.,negative
My threads app working but when i scroll the first screen stays and the scrolled pard overlapping the pervious content its looks like a mess even i switch home to my profile its still overlapping.,negative
"Its an awesome app, simple and minimalistic (maybe too much) instagram needs to add some features like saving photos and translate language",positive
I was very excited about the threads app but it is not starting It was showing glitche screen fro very first time I have downloaded it I am not able to use the app even for a single second Please fix this issue Instagram,negative
"It is a great site for keeping up with the latest news from top journalists. Also, it is not a cesspool of white supremacy and hate as opposed to the dying bird site.",positive
"Once you get over the fact that your timeline is literally every brand in the universe and you have to mute all of them to see suggested posts that are closer to who you follow, it's... A Twitter app alright.",positive
First day: Enjoyed seeing things from people I follow and know. Second day: My feed was full of corporate garbage and posts from randoms. Inmediately uninstalled it. And no way to change it back.,negative
It scrolls so slowly. I think the developers probably forgot that not everyone uses a phone with high refresh rate. It doesn't scroll smoothly like Twitter.,negative
Honestly! It's a good app but it can't be compete with Twitter because it's has very limited and so much boring features and Twitter has much Fun but hopefully it will improve in future! But now time I gave it 1 star ⭐,negative
Threads has bug in it when I use every words and letter are reflected multiple times and crashes the app. I request @instagram to fix it . Note: My mobile is 4 GB Ram Redmi note 6 pro,negative
"Smooth, clean, just a little buggy at the moment re: posting pics. Keeps crashing.",positive
UI is great I wish you have this kind of UI on WhatsApp and fb too but excuse me can you please rather then making a different app put all threads features on Instagram somewhere. 2 different features in one app will be better.,negative
There's nothing of substance at all. My feed is not personalized. I followed all the people I follow on Instagram but instead of seeing their posts I just was forced to look at a ton of celebrities whose posts I do not care about and do not want. I am going to uninstall now because this was not an enjoyable experience.,negative
"Downloaded on day one and have througoly enjoyed this app since. People actually interact with each other and far right trolls don't even last a day. Oh, and I haven't seen a single ad!",positive
It has good design and all but the app itself has bug it always glitches so you can't even use it. But i hope they'll fix it.,negative
"Looks stable on Android so far. Please add an option to disable ""Autoplay"" function for videos.",positive
Nice UI. But we can't save pics and I wish there is an option to only see the threads from the people we follow. Also no dark mode.,positive
"There is unnecessary things on your feed and there is no option to view only following ones, everything becames about photos and photos, of this is another Instagram then why the f i use this over twitter, Twitter is still the best..",negative
Bugs.... Everytime I open the home page... It keeps blurry and showing some duplicating effect of texts.... Still needs more improvements,negative
"No problem with the app so far, but my timeline looks awful. It's full of cringeworthy posts from blue checkmark accounts that no one asked for. Algorithm cringe level is 999",negative
"Discovery is difficult, any post of advertising creator merch on there will be hidden from discovery instantly without notice, so smaller creators who use this platform will end up having issues, i did it as a one time experiment using my creator account @pandaherocommunity and it was hidden publicly on the threads browser, currently only my public personal account is getting discovery benefits, but post engagement is close to zero.",negative
Works well enough. It would benefit by creating a separate feed for the people I follow and another for the trending topics. Just my 2 cents.,positive
It's a great app but It would be better if I could switch accounts like Instagram. And I can't see how many people I follow. I would be grateful if these two things could be updated.,positive
Second day with app and there's a bug. The app won't open and says I've changed the password. I have not. Disappointed.,negative
"An edit function would be nice. Also, there is a bug wherein you cannot preview if a post is liked on the main news feed",positive
"The layout is so bad. It looks awful and feels too minimalistic, like there was no care put into how it looks",negative
A buggy mess right now. Photos fail to upload without any rhyme or reason. App's got potential but shouldn't just be another Twitter ripoff.,negative
"Crashes alot and as a Twitter dupe!/alternative so many features are missing like lista, seeing your followers and following quickly, crashes, just a lot to be asked of",negative
Runs well and is easier to use than twitter while not as much content as older social media (this is to be expected for a young app) it is easy to use and set up shows great promise,positive
"Why when I use it , it's glitching . I did screenshot it. Does my device not compatible. It can't be, cause I'm able too download & play games like genshin impact, etc .",negative
"Totally in love with the app. It's been only few hours using it. I'll let you guys know if there are any drawbacks as well. This is similar to Twitter app, but in more fun way 😄",positive
This is the best app I had ever used. Its logo is very attractive. Its has autocorrect feature also that is very helpful. So guy's What's the delay Download threads now and follow my threads account : parkour_community_1,positive
"It was great until for some reason I get ""something went wrong"" message. I CAN'T post, comment, or even look at my own profile. Reached out and no help.",negative
A good app. I like that you can actually view threads from different people without a chronological order. The randomness of this app is awesome,positive
It ain't working for me. It's glitching. Bro fix it. I want to use the app. I have installed and uninstalled it like 2 times.,negative
"It is a very good app but there is a small problem, if we delete it when we don't need it, our Instagram account will also be deleted. Other than that, it's a better app than Twitter",positive
"You should give a chat section as well so if someone wants to talk then he can. And if you say that we can chat on Instagram, that is a different thing but I strongly advise to add a chat section.",positive
The app is not working properly There's a glitch in it Whenever I open the app everything on the interface just starts to vibrate..... Can't even read it properly Help it out,negative
"It's buggy, full of bugs and posting failed continuously, also app crashes on my high end processor phone.",negative
"Exactly what I was looking for when I left Twitter! Comments and replies should display your own at the top though, so you know your post went thru or if you want to fix an autocorrect error",positive
"Add a dislike button to the all and it's 5 stars, it's more interactive that way, and some hilarious moments will come from it, the app will blow up with this simple change",positive
"What is this app, it does not working at all....the app is too laggy sorry I don't know what it is I should called but the worst app ever....please fixed the bug...... I wish I could saw you some photo or some thing...but that not possible.... THANK YOU",negative
"Not visible, when opens app after the first screen there are blurry vision. And no support from them.",negative
"Needs a couple more features, such as bookmarks, being able to see quotes, etc. But overall a good substitute for twitter",positive
The feed is completely useless. As for content the non humourous meme pages are all over. If they are not then some random person posting her pic making it Instagram 2.0.,negative
"Would love it if I can see the posts I've liked. Also a download option, as well as visible buttons for videos (play, mute, etc.).",positive
I'm the first review! This seems phenomenal! Look i only have one problem. I'm an influencer and when I logged in with insta I had 0 followers on threads while all of them on Instagram. You should have an option to keep the following same as it takes months to build it again and is very frustrating. EDIT : Get hashtags back!!,positive
"Great so far, but its missing the option to be able to search for tags & keywords, and also a following page. Id like to be able to see posts for those who im following in one place, please add this",positive
"Alright, 83rd review for the Threads on Google play. The app is alright, first flight is nice and shine. Everything is smooth. Hashtags don't seem to serve it's purpose though.",positive
This is great app where everyone can explore more and more information and their thoughts 😀 😊. I just want to give thanks to Mark Zuckerberg and his tech team who make this fantastic app for all of us. I'm happy with this thread app. Thank you,positive
"Your policy meant nothing. I cant uninstall this app as my account is interlinked and ""will delete my account if uninstalled"". Dear Meta, please change your policy. If not, its your loss that this app has 3.0 ratings...",negative
"Nothing new: tweeter of Meta But it doesn't work well with Gboard and you have to write blindly, without know what exactly you are writing. Nada nuevo, un Twitter de Meta. Pero no funciona bien con Gboard y el teclado cubre que estás escribiendo, así escribes a la ciega",negative
"Viable Twitter alternative. However, continually shows threads of people I don't follow. There are no settings to change this. This makes it essentially unusable 🤷‍♂️",negative
"The app is new and exciting. I have few suggestions though. First, it would be ideal for users to be able to join without having an IG account, not all of us have or prefer using IG. Good start Meta.",positive
"This has lot of potential ,in 6 months to one year time this could be a Twitter 🐦 killer !? This app is very easy to use n set up when you have an Instagram account ! 5 🌟 for now 👀",positive
Great app. Scrolling needs to be fine tuned. It seems to scroll slower than other apps relative to how fast I'm swiping.,positive
Good work by insta team . But problem is that I can't be able to retrieve/add my threads ID after I remove it from instagram profile. Please work on it . Thank you 😊,positive
Instagram info migration is good. However only follower feed option on home is a MUST feature. Wont use the app if that isn't implemented.,negative
I love the clean interface and the lack of pointless config however why is my feed filled with people I don't follow??? I've tried the suggested work arounds and they don't work,negative
"Good features, but downloading pictures and videos is not allowed there. No option of share link of post.",positive
"The app is Horrible, each time I wanted to post or even text something, that app keeps closed. I am very disappointed of Meta for copying Twitter. Twitter is better.",negative
"Platform is good but confused, is there was a need of it? It is a combination of Insta and Twitter we can say like it. Let see further Threads will be a game changer or not. My personal opinion is there was not need of it.",positive
"It would be better if I could only see threads from people I follow, instead of the whole world. How is this any different from twitter? And would also be better if it was just within the Instagram app itself.",negative
"Just used one day of it and the next day always prompt I've been logged out and the owner might change password. Well, it's connected with my IG and never changed password though.",negative
"Needs more development, but most definitely a good alternative for Twitter and great for anyone who likes keeping up with real verified people, not bots. Anyone giving lower than a 4 star it just butt hurt Elon fangirl.",positive
User friendly and great experience... It'll do well in the long run. More features needs to be added thou.,positive
"Why must I sign up first for instagram before being able to use this app? I never liked or used instagram and so cannot be forced to, which is why I am uninstalling until the developer/s can think right and make it independent.",negative
"It was working perfectly but all of a sudden it's like glitching I don't know what is the matter, anyone who has an idea on how to fix it just assist me coz this app is supper great I have expirienced it",negative
"The app doesn't work for me, the screen flashes and has errors, my phone is the Redmi Note 6 Pro, it's an old phone but it should be compatible :c",negative
Fix your bug. While scrolling down the post overlap each other and all words jumbled at the same time and collapsed post visible on screen.,negative
The threads app in my phone is very glitchy the letters and posts gets overlap on one another and when I switch windows in between it's also gets overlaped on each other.,negative
"At this point in time, unless there is a Tweetdeck like option to filter content, it is a colossal waste of time to cull through the unwanted nonsense.",negative
"Why when you comment more than 2 lines, you can't see the second line and now you're typing blind? My keypad blocks the text box. This is annoying.",negative
The feed is nothing but suggested people and threads with maybe 1% of who you actually follow (much like Facebook but without an option for following only). Take a note from Twitter and make a Timeline where you get what you want or this app will fail,negative
The app overall is pretty good! Though it crashes when I try to post a thread with a picture.,positive
"App looks good but it's unfinished.I can't download pics no # . Like button should be on right or at least can change left or right . Meta just rush it out cuz they wanna be the first to rival with Twitter.Still need a lot to do and I don't think this will beat Twitter cuz main reason people use Twitter is because nsfw content.Thread should at least allow nsfw content and give user whether they wanna hide it or not.Its not that difficult,other social media app have it.",negative
After removing or hiding the Threads badge from Instagram profile it can't be replace or unhide. It's a bad issue in this application. So update features to replace or unhide the Threads badge to instagram account.,negative
Having a lot of problems when I move the feed up or down it freezes straight away and doesn't seem to move. Please solve this problem.,negative
"My app has been hanging, the text and images aren't clear, please do something about it. I really need to start accessing the app",negative
"Complicated interface, not interested in this app, very booring, there should be improvement in user interface, it's far worse than Twitter or Instagram",negative
"The app is overall good. But we can't make two accounts. Means on insta we can login two accounts. But on threads, I can't login another account.",negative
"It's glitchy on my phone. Like everytime I scroll, the text or pic become shadowy or shaded. Please, optimize it. My device: Mi Mix 2",negative
The cool thing about @threadsapp for me is the ability to have actual conversations and build communities and friendships through sharing thoughts instead of sharing content. I like talking. I like listening. I like threads.,positive
Its a good up funny to be honest and generally social but kindly it has a small problem.... Has a glitch as you scroll down.... With that fixed all will be good........... I can't use it because of the glitch,negative
"So far so good buuut I keep getting kicked out, and I use a Chromebook, not a phone so how do I make screen bigger? I know its a work in progress, so I'll be patient.",positive
Look very similar to Twitter... But quite interesting one of the best feature is it is connected to Instagram.. so we cane follow the same people's..... Definitely it can beat the Twitter,positive
Super but... I like it as social network but to move from Twitter needs some tweeks. 1- should have option to see whom I follow only. 2- l wish to have option to see Instagram followers and out side Instagram community. I'm looking forward to reach stage get rid of Twitter under Musk. I hope this will be soon.,positive
This may become my go-to social media app. They just need to add an edit feature. But it's definitely a kindler and gentler world than Twitter.,positive
Needed to move away from Twitter so bad. Threads is great and is scaling really well so far. Clean interface and fun to use! Bye bye Elon' dumpster fire called Twitter!,positive
"I'm really loving threads so far. My only suggestions would be to provide having multiple accounts logged in like Instagram does, and some UI customization like themes and colors, maybe headers for our accounts.",positive
Recently I installed the spp on my phone but it keeps on flickering and unable to read anything...please help me to fix it....I don't feel giving one star but my situation nakes me to do it..Definitely I'll give 5star if you guys help me to fix my issue.my android version us lollipop.,negative
Great app. Downside : I want curate my home be to be able to only see the content of the people follow my friends. As opposed to what's trending from a bunch of people I don't know.,positive
"This app is fantastic! The user interface is sleek and intuitive, making it a breeze to navigate. The features are well-designed and incredibly useful. Thank you for creating such a great app!""",positive
"Sure, there will be some issues with a new app. Including features that others are demanding. Give the team some time please! Threads is already superior than other similar platforms.",positive
"This app is not working well on my phone. It's repeating the writing on the screen, the app look exactly like twitter though.",negative
The app is crashing as soon as I get to the main feed. Going directly to posts etc via notifications doesn't do that.,negative
"I very like it, more ez to use than twitter, ui simple and enjoyable. But of course things can be improve. I hope you can add hashtag,gif, and i hope also yall can seperated of our friend thread and global. Overall goodjob ✨💪",positive
"OMG, User interface is mind blowing and user experience is lagging, like its little bit confusing. #threads will roar the market. As a UI Ux Designer the first impression was 💜💥.",positive
Everything is fair but we even can't change our threads username. It's same as the instagram. It uses all the instagram information that i don't like so. But 2 star for this app will be fine. I think so...,negative
The feed is littered with people I don't know or care about. If my feed consisted of people I follow it would be pretty good. Spend most of my time on there muting/blocking people,negative
I'm rating 4 stars. The app itself is not so good for use but it has built a large community. May be in future they introduce all the other features. Right now there are so few things to do here. But I hope it will become better than other platforms.,positive
People don't understand that this app is just launched recently so it will take some time to get more features. It'll become very popular medium of expressing own thoughts in the future,positive
"My problem with this app is that it doesn't translate what others are saying. I stan GOT7 💚 but 4 of the members are Koreans, I don't understand korean, I need this app to translate.",negative
"Can only log in via Instagram and then when trying to create Instagram account no verification emails or SMSs are sent. Keep it, I'll stick to Twitter, Elon and all.",negative
"The app is very big crash, full of bugs, but it's good to see Instagram is trying something new fantastic keep it up",positive
Ok in its beginning stages but - FYI crashes everytime I switch accounts. Have to uninstall then reinstall like 20 times already in order to check on both accounts.,positive
"Hmmm, my device got a bug. So apparently my screen only stack each activity so it will be unuseable even for scrolling. My device is Sony Xperia XZ1 SOV36. If your team can fix it I will be gladly rate it 5 stars",positive
"I get that you want to promote or show messages from other users, but please, for the love of all that is good, give me the option to turn that off. I only want to see messages from the people I follow, not everyone else on the platform",negative
"Pretty cool app. It's quite seems like Twitter, but it's still quite interesting to use and explore. Hopefully, this application will be famous as same as Facebook with over 5B downloaders.",positive
"Threads app needs a lot of work, but as a basic experience it actually functions well, much more than can be said of Twotter nowadays.",positive
"For a while I give one star, because this application does not have a system to restore hidden thread badges on the Instagram profile. If there was, I would give 5 stars.",negative
"Overall a nice application, feels like something fresh in the market but this definitely needs some brand new things that would make it unique compared to other platforms 🐒",positive
"It's cool so far, just lacking some basic functions like trending topics and bookmarking posts. I hope some of these will be added in the future.",positive
Loving it. Feed seems so out if place though. There are so many random posts. Would love to get an option for choosing global and followers tweets.,positive
This app is really amazing. A very good alternative for Twitter. Please add a translate option. It'd be really helpful...,positive
Waste of time if you don't have Instagram. Again if you don't have one you can't get other. This app removes my freedom of choice. Super unhappy.,negative
I'm sad abt this... Coz... I installed three times but when I open it I'm not getting app properly... Some tym of glitch is occured. I need it to be work good.. Hope u will take action on it,negative
"No DM, No search function, No hashtag support, No ability to only see people I follow in my feed and it's just an endless torrent of random verified accounts you've never heard of. This is the brain dead cousin of Twitter; not its replacement. Even with the 600 tweet cap, Twitter has significantly more functionality and purpose.",negative
Downloaded the app but there was no place to sign up or seeing where to login through Instagram but still that doesn't even work. Meta is way bigger than something as poor as this.,negative
"Okay Markus and the Threads crew, listen up. I NEVER write reviews, so you know I liked this app. I don't wanna have to come back and lower it, so hear me out: KEEP IT SIMPLE. From what I can tell, the main draw for a lot of people is the simplistic interface, and how clean and refreshing it feels to not be bogged down by engagement. PLEASE KEEP THAT. Obviously Threads isn't in its final form, but something about it is special 😭 Please be careful. Thassit, be easy, y'all ✌🏽",positive
"The new app is totally different and so awesome! But something is going on with the app now, I can't refresh my account or comment nor post why ? Hope my account isn't having any issues yet ? Or is it from threads app ?",positive
"As I tap on speaker option to enable audio, video just gets paused automatically and then I'm unable to unpause it until I turn off the audio :/",negative
"First version is still basic, less functionality, I like the design, and I hope the app followed changing to be better.",positive
The worst app by meta. It behaves like a bug and the pages are overlapping each other. No matter what I try it's the same... Hate it,negative
"A good app so far. The people are nice and caring unlike that bird app. It needs some things yet, but I'm sure they will get there. I'm happy with it so far. ☮️🖖",positive
I like the app. It has beautiful UI/UX designs. It's smooth and most importantly it's simple.,positive
"Please the app so far is Good. I'm having a challenge since yesterday whenever I try to upload a photo as a thread,the app shuts down. Please try and fix it.",positive
It's been very smooth. I really love this app..... We need the tending topics and Spaces functionality added to it. Thank you.,positive
"There needs to be a way to turn off auto playing video, and there needs to be a chronological feed with only posts and shares from people I follow.",negative
"Do NOT install! The app is following accounts automatically on behalf of my account or sending follow request without me knowing. I don't even open the up, just receiving the notifications. Isn't that illegal Zuck??",negative
This is basically Twitter with Instagram theme. The set up was too smooth. Edit: I will suggest that trending topics should be visible when users click on the search section,positive
"Not sure how i feel. It's a great concept, but it's also made by the same corporation that doesn't seem to be able to give basic customer support to users of facebook and instagram.",negative
"The UI is very broken, I can't even scroll without stuff completely breaking. Can't even describe.",negative
"Meh. I never wanted my ""twitter"" life and Instagram to be the same place. Plus I can't delete my account without deleting my Instagram so that's pretty manipulative. Twitter is still somehow better, which is saying a lot.",negative
"Actually this app doesn't work properly. As soon as I opened this app, there will be overlapping of everything I see la. I don't think it will work la 🥴",negative
"I can't see the settings icon on the profile , page top right corner, somehow it works when i click the empty space besides the Instagram icon😅, fix that and bring Deep dark mode theme ASAP",negative
"App is good all perfect but i really appreciate if you guys.. threads team add a group chat,private message,profile banner,content selection and voice",positive
"I feel really old, but I remember this app from back in the day called Twitter—it feels incredible, how far we have come as a species.",positive
Amazing app. Thanks to Zuck and his company. It's a wonderful app with a wonderful beginning. But there's a lot to integrate and configure in the app.,positive
"Has stopped working for the last hour but, phenomenal work. This will bring life to the Instagram society with variety of attachments included in a single thread. Please keep it away from bots.",positive
"I love the app but there are two major problems, it glitches and the writing overlaps itself, you also can not see the comment you're making, if these are fixed it'll be 10x better then Twitter",positive
Terrible. No engagement. Not even worth signing up. Make sure to uninstall it and don't leave their spyware hanging around on your phone.,negative
i give 1 star. this app is good but dont give the option to just see the Threads only from the people we follow ! why must i read from strangers ?? enough with the random strangers rant in our feed ! and there's no translation service. good thing is it filters out p0rn unlike shwitter.,negative
Its good and wasy to use. The design is simple and understandable unlike other apps that just have all the things jumbled up. I like it.,positive
"Pls consider to separate it from insta honestly. Like it's quite unsafe to be logged with only one acc and one password, if one go down, another will too.",negative
"There is no option to join without using instagram. I'm trying to limit my exposure to social media and not spend my days browsing social internet like these vultures would like you to. This was only an expression of interest, I will move on.",negative
"For giving support to someone I know I installed this app ""Threads "" but when I come to know that If we delet this account same way my Instagram account which i have will also get deleted it's just against our freedom to use the app and the control was commanded by META.. not just me but many like me was wishing to delet this app without loosing data form Instagram...",negative
"Good job, really an alternative to twitter . Now there's a need to provide option so text can be increased for people like me who found the text to be tiny Thumps up",positive
Forced close on launch. Had been great.. added 200 of the 300 twitter people I follow (mostly just EU accounts missing now). But desperately needs a keyword search to find anything other than what the people I follow said.,positive
"Its pretty decent, however I'm having problems with my notifications. I get the notifications VERY late, sometimes DAYS later.",positive
"At first I had a waiting list for confirmation of follow requests.. I started to confirm one by one, but when I refreshed that list is hide. Where I can return back or found it again?",negative
"so far so good here, very minimalist and not to overwhelming app with bunch of numbers at the bottom of a post.",positive
"The app is mad glitchy, like I just logged in first time and everything is glitching worst than the matrix, I don't what happened or is the app incomplete or what but I cannot even scroll!",negative
"Good app,,, though some things must be fixed to have the best One. Pic must be easy to download as in Twitter, chat features and remove auto videos play its killing our bills",positive
"Loving the app There's still some stuff needed like pinning posts. I keep getting shut out of the app, I don't know if this could be looked into",positive
"Can't search anything that i want to see just getting random posts of random blue tick people on my home page, give me what i want to see not what you want to show me. And every next post is about twitter vs threads looks like this app was not made for entertainment it was made to war with twitter",negative
"Just updated the app , it keep saying i've been logged out of %1$s account owner may have changed the password , an account i just created days ago , you need to fix this!!",negative
"Needs improvement, but I'm on board... Improvements in: pinning, hashtags, searching for threads, threads of followers vs. for-you, and the UI speed for some reason.",positive
"A decent enough Twitter clone but cycling through irrelevant content just makes it feels exhausting. App needs a Followers tab or a better algorithm soon, or we're going to bail.",negative
More annoying to use then Twitter. Its just needlessly complicated and basic at the same time. Just stick to standard instergram.,negative
Really a great app. A great platform to engage with everyone. Also the reach and impression are adequate.,positive
"Seriously, there's no way to limit my feed to only the accounts that I follow? Without that functionality, this app is nothing but a torrent of useless noise from celebrities and influencers, and I'm not interested.",negative
"Not bad, but the switch between accounts not possible !!!!! And the videos somtimes with no audio. Using galaxy S21 Ultra",negative
The app's been working smoothly to me but I do hope more features will be added soon tho. Like you can also search for keywords or hashtags and read the requotes of a tweet.,positive
"It's so buggy. All of my threads for the past 48 hours got deleted for I don't know why. When you try to post a photo, it goes to your IG feed - meanwhile they said that the app is for conversation.",negative
This app has been frustrating me since. I can't post or make a comment and my app keep logging out on its own. I just updated it and yet still same problem. Please you guys should do something about it,negative
"Threads app offers a seamless and engaging social media experience, with it's user-friendly interface, real time updates and vibrant community, making it a must-have for connecting and sharing with others.",positive
"Post notifications are delayed af, some posts get visualised as repries in the feed with that donut string, the ig symbol vanishes from all profiles, the sound symbol on videos just vanished! Why even release such an incomplete product?",negative
It is a very great app like it so smooth but one thing I don't like they asking for a lot of you data like your health and fitness ..... this one other then that great app room for improvement,positive
Logged out to log into a different account and now I can't get in at all and the app crashes every time I open it to attempt to login.,negative
"Amazing conversations, amazing people and amazing Experiences... This is what we build at Meta Threads The conversation Opener... Probably the perfect ad copywriting( lol) Best app.",positive
I don't know about bugs but app sucks a lot keep stopping while writing something and getting back with a message not responding! Oh problem start,negative
"Oh boy, let me tell you about Threads app - it's like Twitter and Instagram had a baby, but with a hilarious sense of humor! I've never laughed so much while scrolling through a social media app before.",positive
Horrendous. Crashes. Can't choose albums when uploading. An app about threads but can only post 4 images per thread .,negative
4 stars for the whole application but can you put a button for save pictures it's hard to save a picture from the app. Thank you.,positive
"When I installed this app it doesn't work properly and work like it's hanged my screen doesn't work properly in this app, and I was trying to work properly automatically from 2 days but it doesn't .",negative
"I was sent a ""Your account has been suspended."" message from instagram a day after using this app (without any posts to Threads *or* Instragram, note.) The ""appeal suspension"" process requires a few obnoxious recaptchas, then writing your real name and taking a selfie, so this may just be more datamining from Meta, but it's insanely obnoxious either way.",negative
"I like the basic fitur such add much image and the slide layout really versatile, love it this far. Looking forward for updates features",positive
So far so good. But I think it'll be best if followers and followings on instagram are automatically sent to threads since they're both found in one space.,positive
"A complete mess on screen as it's not refreshing correctly on my Android phone (v9), so until that's fixed, it's unusable",negative
Oh I am the first one to review on this...so I would like to thanks everyone including thread and Instagram team and my friends and well-wishers and also those who are not well wisher..without your support or guidance ..my first review would have not been possible..thanks a lot . :),positive
"First and foremost, the fact that I cannot delete my account is completely unacceptable. As a user, I should have the right to control my online presence and decide whether I want to continue using the app or not. However, this app has taken away that freedom, leaving me feeling trapped and powerless.",negative
"The app Glitches. Texts Images everything, overlaps on itself, gets on top of each other. And I can't see anything, nor usethe app",negative
"Missing features like trending topics, search by keyword, filtering results by location, etc.",negative
"I think there is something wrong with the app because when I try to enter my password in the account sense I forget it automatically it stopped, why is that and even in Instagram when I tried to change it it stopped too 🤷🤷🤷 what's wrong ⁉️",negative
"Great start, i think thread will overtake twitter very quickly, of course since elon musk bought twitter, most of all it has come with a lot of restrictions which the user base doesn't like anymore but There are still some trust issues in the thread because this application also asks to access your complete data. And major part ~ YOU CAN'T DELETE YOUR THREADS ACCOUNT WITHOUT DELETING YOUR INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT",positive
More like Instagram than Twitter. Too much media. You can't even disable videos being played automatically! That's a big issue for me!,negative
Seems pretty decent. UI Translations need bit polish. The Top action bar looks empty. Dark mode is great.,positive
"Open app, mute 3 to 4 profiles I don't follow that are showing up in my timeline, close app. Not great so far.",negative
Why is the treads account linked to your Instagram account? It's so annoying. This should be the user's choice if they want an account on threads or not. Meta really needs to change this.,negative
But please add on translation features so the conversation throughout the diversity of language can be transparent with each other in this community. Hope you take this as consideration.,positive
"It's ok but cannot download videos or images like I can on Instagram or twitter and Facebook, maybe some one will get around to writing on or just use the Instagram's downloader.",negative
"Guys, honestly I'm saying don't install this app, read all his data collection detail.. your data will be collected including your voice recording or even your payment info.. 🙏 uninstall this..",negative
Almost identical to but even worse than Instagram if that's possible. Still can't comment pics. Who developes a social media app without pictures? A fkn lizard! That's who!,negative
Once I open the app shows overlapped content consistently Giving us a dizziness and irritation. 2. Unable to download the media like photos making it very difficult to use this if we want the media.,negative
"Trust me when I say this app is crazily amazing, I like the fact that it is connected to your Instagram account, and it is quite easy to navigate",positive
At first it is okay . But now I can't seem to post anything on threads also I cant see any of my previous post on threads it keeps saying try again later. I tried to uninstall the app and re installed again but it is still the same. Please do fix this bug issue. I already report on threads.,negative
Great app. Great potential. Great additions would be a following only feed & a DM system that's integrated with messenger & instagram DMs. A better followers & following system is also needed.,positive
"it literally does not work, every time I try to do anything, even just scroll down, all the text and buttons overlap on each other",negative
"I really hope Threads make a traslate button bottom of the each thread text like twitter, if like that many non english user like me will use this app 100 times more, I hope read english thread more without copy and paste the text to translate app",positive
It's a really great application. I totally enjoyed using it. Please release a Thread Lite version so people with less storage can also use it... Good luck Team,positive
"Still has a long ways to go. Please don't show me suggested Influencers or Pages I don't follow. I don't want to see half my feed of posts I have no desire or care for just to help increase their platform. Show me only what I specifically follow. Also, you should consider adding a Trending page and not JUST a search function page.",negative
Greate app with good features and also fast but want I don't like about the app is that when you want to comment on a post the comment box will be under the keyboard and will will restrict you from seeing what you are typing. Hope it will be resolved,positive
I am disappointed for your threads app your app is after the download then I enter your app the app flickering and a page is like disconnected cable connection problem🤣🥴. So to solve the problem,negative
"Home page is some nightmare algorithm, like Twitter's ""For you"". I simply want to only see posts from people I follow. A ""lists"" feature would be nice too.",negative
"Smooth and easy. Everything is clear for to understand, and the upgrades are lit. 👍",positive
"So far it's what it should be. A new ""Twitter"" like app by Meta for meta users. It's a little rough around the edges obviously, it hasn't even been 24 hours. It's fun and easy to use, no rate limits!",positive
App is facing some issues. It's not working properly and glitches are showing in the feed.,negative
"Not what I expected.. with that being said I was informed if I delete the app my Instagram gets deleted as well. Why would you do that.. not a fan of it, it's complicated if you ask me. Disappointing",negative
Very simple easy to use and amazing applicationI'm looking forward to the live streaming and audio chat functionality between friends,positive
"Great so far, needs a following feed and also fix video playback and having no sound on Android.",positive
"I think i Love this apps its amazing. I believed and got confidence that threads app have now kicked off Twitter, i was frustrated by Twitter millions times. Keep it up, Threads to the World",positive
"The app is good because I can share what's on my mind, but the problem is there's no followback button. You need to visit the profile first so you can follow it back",positive
"Excited for this one. Ofc being 1st day means some glitches here and there, like the like animation isn't all that intuitive.",positive
"Sometimes I think to myself, what does this world really need? Like, REALLY need? And the only answer I could think of was a website where you can write short pieces of text and have people from all around the world like and comment on said text. Then BOOM, zucker creates this. Mind blown.",positive
Havent even used it yet as it's unusable. My app is glitiching too much that I am not able to see it's features. please fix this problem,negative
"Good social network. App is OK, but needs features like displaying latest threads chronologically and only from accounts you follow.",positive
"No chronological timeline, no way to show posts from only people you follow, no way to organize lists of topics. A heavily watered down and censored version of Twitter",negative
"It's a really nice one, at least for a start. I just wish there's a better way to search for photos to post, not me going through everything in my gallery",positive
"Chaotic timeline, no chronological order and mostly posts from ppl u dont follow. No options to save data or stop videos auto play. Back to twitter hopefully till ur app updates satisfy twitter users' taste",negative
"Overall it looks good, It would be even better if it could show the trending topics like it shows on Twitter, it makes it more interesting",positive
Need fix for my phone. When i scroll the entire screen just look shredded and unreadable so it's unusable for me atm. I'm waiting for this issue to be fixed. Ty... .,negative
A copied version of Twitter. It's glitching so much and boring. Just it's new & by Instagram that's why people came to see. Otherwise nothing new and good. Boring App.,negative
It'll be very great thing to make that app different from other apps by deleting every stupid thing and closing toxic people accounts you found in other apps . MAKE IT DIFFERENT BY MAKING IT SAFE PLACE FOR EVERYONE.,positive
"Will only show me posts from brand accounts and celebrities, with no way to either tailor the stream, or see a 'following only' style stream. Totally useless for staying up to date with the accounts you care about. Disappointing.",negative
It keeps on flickering. Images and text are garbled. Unusable at the moment.,negative
Love at first sight! Just have a small suggestion: Can you add a feature to save Threads just like saving posts on IG. I think like I'm missing a lot while scrolling.,positive
"It's just a clone app of Twitter. But i like it more than twitter.. please don't allow users to upload adult contents as like twitter do. Lovely app, thanks to team meta for giving us a good platform to express our feelings through words. 😊",positive
The icing on the cake is how seamlessly Threads integrates with other Meta-owned platforms like Facebook and Instagram. I can easily share content across these platforms without any hassle.,positive
"The app screen glitches every time I scroll, like it glitches so hard that the text becomes unreadable. Does anyone else experience this too? Or is it just me?",negative
"It's not owned by a wannabe politician, but it's embarrassingly basic for a Facebook product. Needs hashtags or just a search feature, and a Trending list.",negative
"This app seems smooth. It is, clearly, supposed to be like twitter, but i count it as a positive that now I can have twitter and instagram together in the same place. First.",positive
"it's a really good app,i sometimes don't receive any notifications on it unless i open it then notifications come in but it's good nothing to complain about so far.",positive
"Not terrible so far, I wish that I could filter content to only see the people I follow though. But for day one not a terrible app, just needs some time to improve",negative
"Can't even use this app, everything is shaking and copies of same text, icons on each other. Please optimise this app for Android.",negative
"So far, it's a positive experience and no opening day glitches. Feels like a slumber party with all the fun and Intentional kindness.",positive
"No lists - the key Twitter feature. Also: you can't choose a username, it is the same as in Instagram.",negative
"useless app no hashtags feature,no freedom of speech because you can also block any account, no direct message, big pictures like it is Instagram not microblogging app.",negative
I'll give it a 4 rating Good features Unique interms of censorship.. Suggestions 1. Let people that Follow you be visible Alone. 2. Need to also give opportunity to edit name without changing it from instagram.,positive
"It's new, give it a chance! This is everything Twitter isn't and I'm so good with that! They are still making tweeks to the system but the best part is, there are no fascists!!",positive
"This app seems pretty good so far, but I have noticed that any post notifications have been a day late in being delivered!",positive
"Nothing new for obviously reasons. It's missed a big feature from the other: anonymity. People liked the other cause they could be someone else, a fun username and share random thoughts, far from real life people, so... Some people said that if your ig is on dark mode, than threads will also be. My ig is on dark mode and yet threads is on light. Would be better if this setting was a part, just add dark mode button on threads.Also you can't delete the account unless you delete your ig account.",negative
"Tangles would be similar to hashtags on Instagram, but they would be specific to Thread. Tangles would allow users to easily find and follow conversations on topics that interest them.",positive
"New app, hope to be a good app with no privacy issue and i request instagram to not add reel feature here please 🙏🏻🙏🏻, we are tired of reels , i request developers to make it geneune and no ui or icon changes everymonth , im giving 5 star to be a good app for all our gen and also request to add things in policy with those who put semi nude graphy should be banned ,we want a app who give our mind relax not stress.",positive
Sometimes i cannot post media and app crashes for some reason. But content and people are so wholesome.,positive
Will be a great addition with the associated linking to Instagram and Facebook. Great job Mark! Keep the business decisions based on business and needs. Not political like some other misguided guy!,positive
"Its a good app. I have accidentally unhided the ""thread badge"" from Instagram bio. Please bring an option to add it back. :(",negative
Application is crashing while uploading picture. Can't upload even a single picture of small size. What the hell????,negative
My experience is that I am the 1st user to rate this app . Another experience is that the app is a rivalry motivated product with a expectation to beat Twitter... Let's ride...,positive
I love the app so much .. my pictures no longer auto crop. Hopefully in the next update there will be an album .,positive
"Very promising so far, interested to see where it goes. Will adjust my review later when I've really gotten some good use out of it.",positive
Basically an Instagram remake with Metas same lame rules that until they disappear will not be able to take on Twitter which is a much better app. Lol this app is lame posts the exact same content as on Instagram what is the point,negative
"Ever since I started using this app, I can no longer access the instagram page connected to it. It keeps stopping and It's so annoying",negative
Intuitive and easy to use. Easy sign in and seamless incorporation with Instagram.,positive
"the application looks nice from the outside and from the inside, but there are some hiccups you have in it, such as it doesn't have personal conversations, Twitter and Instagram And I searched for a theme in black when I find until now that it has another theme other than the white color and this does not suit people's thinking most of the time Dear Mark, Verify my personal account on Threads for free and you will be very grateful because I do not have the Enough money verify it by myself Thanks",positive
Id like to suggest to stick associating instagram in this app as much as possible for its uniqueness frome the bird app. I am looking forward for your new ways.,positive
it seems fine really! but it keeps on lagging and the posts are overlapping whenever i start to scroll yeah it's fine. -fix it please,negative
"Smooth user interface so far, looking forward to some improvements and new features",positive
Showing a lot of promise. Just needs some added functions like the ability to search for topics you are interested in.,positive
"I just downloaded the app and connected my Instagram account but the app is lagging a lot , it's not working properly at all , not even able to use a single feature",negative
I'm happy with this app. I want to unhide badge of threads on instagram also there is not other option for bring it back so i request you work for it asap. I appreciate your work. Please understand my concern.,positive
"To much data collection, sensorship, and ownership of images. Zuckerberg don't need anymore apps. His companies phony fact checks to control the narrative is unreal and the extreme censorship of speech. I'll stick with twitter thanks.",negative
Nice interface. Easy to use as of now. Waiting to see more improvements for app stability.,positive
Where are the notifications? The app doesn't have ability to notify you when an account publishes a new thread. Pretty good and fun app otherwise,positive
Just downloaded this and whenever I try to scroll or click on any buttons app started to shutter and when I close the window it is fixed idk why it happens but its annoying and I can't use the app.,negative
This app is under development and this version is quit lite missing some important features but i hope they will bring it in upcoming updates. App is pretty clean,positive
"Only log in thru Insta. Should have been other options too. Downloaded and then deleted as no other log in options available. What if people not having Insta, wanna onboard threads for a different experience",negative
Its not working properly some kind of glitch i suppose but the texts are overlapping i downloaded it multiple times still not working properly same problem plz tell me how to fix this if there is way,negative

"A very good, simple and easy to use app. The only thing that I need ASAP is translation option. Please include it 🥺",positive
"I like it, so far I haven't got any issues and is a user-friendly app. I didn't have to create a new account. Everything was ported from Instagram. Im happy with it 😊",positive
It's smooth and It's twitter and Instagram together I love it can't wait for It's future but I found the wrong one but then I went to the site to find the real app it needs to be #1 that pops up so people can find it,positive
"And how exactly do I read all the content from ppl I follow when the app decides to refresh itself and only show ""discover"" content that I could not possibly care any less about",negative
Am the first to write a review on Mark Zuckerberg new app..wowee I had early access to it in the last few day and I think its great. When u open it u prompt to login with Instagram You keep ur same user name and you can follow the people you are already following on Instagram if u wish...r u can recreat if u wish. U can add a bio automatically import from ig... At a very first glance it feels familiar They not inventing the wheel here. The design is minimum it clean and attractive,positive
"It's moderated Twitter as opposed to 4chan esque current Twitter that is nearly impossible to check in public because it's become overrun by hate and bots for a particular blue and white website. DMs coming soon. Users concerned about privacy; if the app is free, you are the product. There isn't anything on this app that is going to know any more about you than the little tracking/gps/algorithm driven device you carry in your pocket everyday already knows.",positive
It was fine up until a few minutes ago now it's not opening at all my internet is fine but it won't load anything and shows all the people of my insta followed but i didn't,negative
"It's a waste of time. Firstly, it is a copy of Twitter and secondly, this app is being downloaded only because of Instagram's popularity in everyone's mobile and there is nothing different in it.",negative
"I see the possibilties here. 1. I would like the block feature to, you know, actually work. 2. Id really like to mostly just the people I follow. Yes, i know, this is software in development, changes will come.",positive
"This app has massive potential, and even in its current version it's a Twitter heavy hitter. Hashtags and a message link to Instagram would be nice, and word is they are in the works 👍🏽",positive
"App crash whenever I try to post or reply. I can scroll, read, like, and repost as per normal. Edit: Status quo. Drop to 1 star.",negative
The fact that it forces me to see content I don't want gives it a one-star review immediately. I don't want to see any content from anyone other than the followers I have selected.,negative
Smooth onboarding and sync with Instagram. But please allow us to pick media from folder other than root gallery,positive

"Please DON'T DOWNLOAD this app DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME This app has same algorithm like Instagram and Facebook it's track location and put all the celebrity on the timeline I needed the people I follow, but this app is BS I recommend do not download this app all the young man out there, don't waste your time on it go and do some push ups instead of wasting time on it specifically young man work on yourself And I'm now sure Mark Zuckerberg matrix agent",negative
"It doesn't even work for me well, I always get ""Sorry something went wrong, Please try again!"" like I keep getting this error, please fix it! 😡",negative
"When I open the app, it got a stroke. I cant use the app because once I scroll it got glitched. Also can't see anything in app. Fix this",negative
I think it should automatically recognize your Instagram password and username. Most of us can't remember that. Have been trying to login for more than two days now,negative
"Totally insane this instagram/threads. NEVER had instagram acct. Downloaded threads app, need instagram acct to log in. Set up new acct w instagram Says I have an acct. Reset pwd Now cant log in bcuz of suspicious activity AND all of Instagram emails are in GERMAN ???",negative

"Lacks privacy options. There is just a private-public account switch, it doesn't even let me choose the display name.",negative
"A more than wonderful application, easy to use and uncomplicated, unlike many applications, it is wonderful and deserves more than five stars, thanks Mark",positive
The restriction messages are annoying and once they start you won't follow people successfully even when you are logged in. You follow on your endand the person is not followed on the other end,negative
Great onboarding experience! I already like it way better than Twitter. The app works smoothly and is well-designed.,positive
"For some reason, I cannot use this app properly. It's having a glitch throughout and it's annoying. The whole page is filled with glitches. Please do something about it.",negative

What about privacy? The app is collecting all the private datas such as photos videos location phone numbers email msgs every thing this app has serious privacy issues i would never recommend anyone to use this app,negative
"I installed this only bc I hate the new Elon Musk contolled Twitter SO much. I'm quite confident that many others feel the same way. I hope it's good, but at least it can't be any worse than the new Twitter. It must be hard to be both a genius and a dope at the same time!",positive
"nice. but i have a suggestion for you to fix the damn thing where when we delete our reply but under the post it still counted the reply (even when u tryna see it there's none) yes, that. pls remove it, thanks. for a better experience",positive

"this app is glitching, i don't know what happened but this app is not working. im trying to use it but it is always glitched. kindly please fix this.",negative
"Growing pains, but to be expected. Give us a tab or option on the homescreen which shows ONLY the activity from people we're following and I think you'll have a winner. As it stands, my feed is clogged with stuff from people I, frankly, don't care about.",positive
"Where is the edit button? And each time i open an app it says ""posting"" not sure what it is posting each time i open it lol. Fix it up ya'll.",negative
I guess there's room for improvement... My keyboard is covering what I'm typing... Is that from the app? It's definitely from the app because I experience it only on this app. Kindly look into it. Thank you,positive

Very easy to use and people friendly. I'd like to see the upcoming updates the app would make.,positive
It is Absolutly true that instagram always do best for their user but after giving this app they do much better Before I use different different app for shorts and for pictures but now I use single instagram for all and i hope threads is also benificial for myself and now I use threads at the position of twi***,positive
Threads is such a fun app but yes it can do with a few improvement but for myself it's perfect the way it is. It's definitely a goodbye to Twitter from me 😁,positive
Awesome. It's is a nice alternative to the bird app. I think it is safe for teenagers and and very nice and warm user base.,positive
"Need to add gif replies major thing, perhaps some banner for profiles would be another one, live photos and videos, and DMS. Also major one trending topics, and being able to search for topics not just people",positive
"Love the simplicity of the interface. Video quality is dope too. Kindly work on DMs, Trends and Edit features.",positive

Whenever i open Threads app it is showing gliches like one post is scratching whole screen if i try to touch search or account it continues same glich please correct it quickly.,negative
"Do not download Threads. You will never ever be able to delete it, unless you delete your Instagram. That is 1000% messed up. Now I'm locked in a 360 deal with an app smh. I didn't want to sign-up, I was just checking it out. Now in stuck with it. So sad smh. The things they do. You can only deactivate. But what if I just don't want it. Why y'all do society like that? Have a heart, let us go if we feel like it.",negative
"its kinda wierd and connecting to instagram with no deletion option independly for it makes it look like a desperate attempt to stay relevant, even though its just been made",negative
"I'm unable to login in this app Below message occurred in popup with dismiss option after click dismiss app is crashed This problem is occurred in pixel 7 android version- 13 Error,Please wait a few minutes before you try again",negative
Add true black out black theme. Not this wash out gray stuff. Saw that iphone users have different black. Why didn't you implemented the same true black out black for android as well?,negative
"Amazing, I love it. Stop using the reviews to request features literally every other app already has and go use those instead. Let us enjoy this! One million stars.",positive
"Since day one I am using this app ...

"There's no direct message, can't see profile photos, can't search by keywords or hashtags, full of limit.. I hope you can improve base on what i wrote above.",negative
"While it's still adding features, sure, it's not MuskTwitter and it's pretty close to the old twitter, so enjoy!",positive
So much glitch and lag... Automatically turns off and stops responding. Please fix this bug ASAP!,negative
"Getting x-rated posts immediately is not a good sign. Having to delete IG to remove this won't bother me, but might be a big problem for others. Privacy not good either",negative
"Always show ""Sorry, something went wrong, Try again"" when I click posts. Something always went wrong when I open someone's main.",negative
Breath of fresh Air! I never knew just HOW toxic the other app had gotten until I switched to Threads. It's only been a week and everyday it gets better and better.,positive
It has still a lot to improve as compared to Twitter... Many features are missing which have to be incorporated.... Hopefully waiting for updates,positive
"Super unstable always keeps crashing while trying to post or repost, I tried posting a photo thrice and it always says post failed to upload and crashes",negative
"Bad interfere, pls fix this for Android 9 version. I connot able to see display is very glitchy.",negative
I am the very 1st person using this app at Vivo phone and leaving a review. So exciting and hope that something interesting will be found from this app. Able to post photo using app in iOS but not android.,positive
Repeatedly screen blinks whenever I try to open threads. I don't know this happening due to my old phone or anything else.,negative

"user friendly, i just hope it also display in the profile the number of followings, and the message button to start the conversation with others. nice app!",positive
This app has a lot of potential and there's definitely some room for improvement. I just wish on the next update they would add the dark mode thingie,positive
The feed is full of glitch. Whenever I enter I only see glitches. But I'm sure it will fixed and we'll get a stable app.And then I ll rate it five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,negative
It's nice. The idea is good but why can't we delete our accounts without deleting our Instagram accounts? Why is there no DM yet? No trend table? Voice threads? A lot has to be done but let's give you guys time,positive
I never liked Twitter and Instagram for too much clutter so I just downloaded the Threads but it has strings attached to login using Instagram actt.. ooops. I have uninstalled the Threads and be happy without any app still giving 4**** be happy,positive
"Lol, tried to login with Instagram. They sent a 6 digit OTP and are requesting 8 digit code in app. Didn't expect meta to submit app with such issues.",negative

"Hi the app is very good ,but pleas update dark mode and bright mode options, if there is bright mode it's good to use on day time , Thanks and it's very usefull app",positive

"Sorry, something went wrong. This is what I get for a week, tried reinstall and clear cache. This app was promising at the beginning",negative
"A refreshing social network that I truly need! Hopefully, the positivity and good vibes from this app will continue throughout the journey.. Better than than Twitter toxic community app! Definitely must try.",positive

This app has a Chinese tracker built in. It says it's safe but it isn't!! I was being tracked secretly. My phone says this app has been using my location 24/7. DELETE THIS APP IMMEDIATELY!!!,negative
"This is so much user friendly than alternative apps. I generally don't like Facebook, but this is solid so far. Elon Musk sucks.",positive
"I like this app so much because it is well organised but you add some feature translation for comments,post, collection post and download for pictures so that it will be more easy to use this app",positive
"Useless app. What purpose does it serve?The same dumb instagram audiences on this app, same type of content, nothing special. Doesn't even come close to twitter in terms of the content and the intellectual type of audience. Another thing to waste time on.",negative
"Im unable to use this app ,Im installing and deleting it for so many times but still whenever i open it there some glitche happening its have been more than 4/5 days i think still the glitch is happening",negative
"So far so good! Apart from a few changes that they've said are in the pipeline this app is very promising, plus it's not twitter which is a bonus",positive
"It's quite easy to use without any complications. I would say this app is the best as a replacement of Twitter, that's for sure.",positive
"great app, need tab about to see the following thread only, and explore of course, and need TREND tab so we can know what the trend or viral right time.",positive
"You have 0 control over what shows on your feed, and the algorithm seems to be very centerlized. It's just another Facebook feed basically",negative
Could you please make the switch account like instagram? It's really bothersome to log out each account because we always get notification for login attempt via email.,positive
I literally can't look at my account and the stuff I've posted or the notifications. Keeps saying 'something went wrong',negative
"It's nice to have an alternative to Twitter, but I feel a lot needs to happen to make it a viable competitor. Great starting point though!",positive
"Like the purpose but unable to see any replies, likes, notifications etc. Just get a message saying 'something went wrong. Please try again'.",negative
Very bad experience withth the app it's shaking and getting blur over all display experience was very bad... !!,negative
I like the idea. But the app keeps crashing and it's incredibly buggy. Please fix it,negative
This is simply a thread. This app is immersive. This app makes you feel like a thread. A solid 9/10. Need to add different varieties of threads and different colours of threads.,positive
It should be having a personal messaging feature also.. I totally loved this app and it's just fab 😍 Just the above mentioned update can make it perfect 😃,positive
"It's filled with glitches, my whole screen glitches everything I open the app. And when I tried deleteing the threads account, it says my Instagram account will be deleted with it. Please fix it and I might change my review.",negative
When I try to write a post the app shuts down. It's done it 3 times in a row now. It's the latest version and fully updated.,negative
ITS GOOOOOOOD and there's still a lot more room for improvement. I really wish they'd add a pin feature! :'>,positive
Annoying like Instagram. Spending all day muting people I don't wanna see. Can't change color theme. Like Twitter but with more noise and less control.,negative
"It's still buggy on my end. Cant even view my feeds cause I might be using old smartphone, Redmi Note 5, android 9. Will change if its working properly.",negative
"Promising, just needs Instagrams dms and gif comments built in(also bookmarks). One thing they have fixed though is no auto refresh the moment you get to the top",positive
"Just a boring app, there's no discovery through topics, you just get posts from influencers meta wants you to follow, and not based on your interests.",negative
"I couldnt post or see other stuffs. The same ""failed to upload "" thing . I did reinstall the app again but it didn't work. This is not how you win over twitter",negative
Have notifications TURNED ON and ALLOWED in the settings yet not getting any notifications. Escalating this issue up higher.,negative
"I enjoyed this app so much. Its has a number of positive outcomes. Obviously I recommended this app. But Threads need to more improvement, like privacy, following system, hashtag and so...on. I hope you will fix it.",positive
Your application don't work properly. It's home screen will speedly shaking. Please fix this issue.,negative
"easy to use better than twitter. no bots or scam people on it 。when the gonna add some features like hashtag , trending more... it's gonna be perfect .",positive
What should I say enjoying using threads or enjoying sewing (🧵🪡) Threads 😆?. Jokes a part Really trying something new and clean . Hope the traffic and the system properties work okh in all conditions also don't want any kind of disturbing ads.overall Enjoying 🧵🪡.(Threads),positive
It's a nonsense app. It's true that anyone who doesn't have an Instagram account can't localize it. It's completely useless,negative
"Great fresh start . UI is Fine and app performance is ok. overall a good app to spend time on , really love new algorithm of reach. i hope this app get updated and not be an twitter",positive
GUI of app is very neat and attractive in the term of simplicity. Loved it... Suggestions: 1. There should be unread thread badge... 2. Unread Threads should be viewed by scrolling down... 3. Translation for all languages should be made available... 4. Top trending threads in the term of hashtags should displayed...,positive
Buggy mess. There are graphical bugs whenever the screen is basically updated.,negative
It's a simple wow experience. No chit chat only post and value and experience sharing..love it..hope to see new features in upcoming update.,positive
"Very good for a first release, and bugs are being fixed noticeably quickly.",positive
"This app is not supported in my mobile (redmi y2). It's like fully messed. If image option is there in this review means, I'll share a screenshot.",negative
"Appalling app. Impossible to post - ""something went wrong"" - and impossible to see reactions - ""something went wrong"". Back to Mastodon.",negative
Please move the post button to the top. My keyboard covers the button up on screen and maybe make the icons bigger or darker so we can see the functions better.,positive
Almost perff Pls add the option to edit the text and this app is golden! Love that it doesnt have DMs too. Reduces the oversaturated and unnecessary convos,positive
It's decent. No iPad app is kind of lame. I wish my 'home' feed had an option to view posts from people I follow and not random accounts.,negative
So far it's good but I think it needs to personalize your feeds and also had a Direct Message option kos I can't be going to Instagram anytime time I want to a have a private conversation with my threads followers,negative
"One of my main reasons for liking Twitter was to follow great journalists and hear and share breaking news, but since Threads has banned Canadian news I don't see a reason to bother trying it out.",negative
Apparently this app doesn't refresh by itself and keeps showing old posts. Even if I refresh it's incredibly slow to do so.,negative
"We need the translation feature that exists on ig. Also, it'd be cool to get the trending now feature or something similar",positive
"plz add a change between accounts feature because when i try to log in and out of accounts, the app crashes and has to be uninstalled and reinstalled",positive
"It's addicting. Great app for socializing. I hope you will add a #hashtag feature, where text with # is highlighted or can be clicked.",positive
"Can't see comments, profile sections. Constantly seeing something went wrong try again later. This is happening for the last 3-4 days.",negative
Great app. I love the change of social media space... I just hope the install and update options are improving.,positive
"Needs a trending/what's hot page, needs tags or a good search topic function, needs chronological feed and a following tab. Way better than bird app from muskrat",positive
People saying this is a twitter killer I think it will be both Instagram and twitter killer this app is fantastic but needs more features but I know head of Instagram said theres a lot of ideas on the table can't wait to see them ideas,positive
"When I log in to instagram, the threads log out. Vice versa. Because of this, my instagram was violated and I couldn't interact with my friends.I can't even comment, like or follow. Fix this issue because I can't open my threads, because I might log out of my instagram again and increase my violation.",negative
"This app is a great alternative to Twitter. You're not bombarded with ads in Threads. With Twitter, ads are unbearable even as a Twitter Blue subscriber. I'll be spending more of my time on Threads as time goes by because Elon has truly made Twitter even more of a cesspool.",positive
"My profile and activity pages don't work even after reinstalling the app again, not sure what's wrong. Is it possible to fix it?",negative
"Not a very well thought out app, looks like a cheap twitter knock off, plus like all other Marks app it will be full of child pr0n within a month or two.",negative
"This poses no threat to Twitter nor will it be a replacement. No direct messaging, no chrono feed, no way to filter to who I'm following so for every thread by someone I do follow, I have to scroll past 1000x more of celebrity boasting & flexing & harbl-measuring.",negative
"I'm on Android phone. Why can't I upload a pic to threads? I could yesterday. Now when I try to add a pic, the app just closes.",negative
"There are lot of glitches happening in my phone, promninent one is layers of interface going over one another. Please fix this.",negative
"It would have been much more better,but it doesn't have a personal message option for users except posting. I hope they bring that soon.",positive
It's great but it could really use a trending tab in the search tab to search keywords. That would be awesome,positive
"Lacks features such as bookmarks, see thread likes, translation threads, and many more, please release these features soon so that this app can replace that blue bird app",negative
"So far, it's a really good alternative to Twitter. I despise Elon and very hopeful for this app. You need to change the policy of having to delete IG if you delete Threads though.",positive
I am really enjoying the new app. The interface is good and user friendly. The feel is better than Twitter,positive
Great app o also waiting to fix the hashtag option and trend page also will be nice if we can join same all our Facebook friends or follower as instegram and option to share any video to another app or downloa I have great suggestions to give the first all first 50 millions the Install it and use it the blue confirm they deserve it because they trust and make other trust,positive
Continue crashing when I upload 5 or more photos or videos. Update take time. Please fix this issue and add edit button.,positive
Pretty barebone right now although it got potential. I wish they'd let us change our handles separately from Instagram. Will be interesting how it'll fare against Twitter however.,positive
"The app is very good and lovely but it need some modification such as dark mode, DM, etc.",positive
"Need to improve a lot , unable to post a picture its always failing to upload , tried almost 10-15 times yet not being able to upload a picture",negative
Amazing app. It needs more clutter and improved UI. And don't forget to add Dark Mode.,positive
App not working all content messing up clustering into each other and text is overlaying multiple time I tried several time same happened please fix it,negative
Why u need to attached this with Instagram. U can make it an individual app. With the feature of reddit and Twitter. Also include the trending option from Twitter. That will be more accurate for threads.,negative
"Sounds simple, clear, and innovative. It would have been better if there hadn't been a footprint of photos and videos.",positive
"The app is simple, but why can't you save pictures. That's what was annoying about Instagram.",positive
"I like the concept, it reminds me of Twitter. but the feed won't work properly it keeps glitching whenever I try to scroll 😔",positive
Constantly crashing on my device. Need to split between followed feed and suggested feed.,negative
Very bugged. Unable to switch accounts without logging out. Also always crashing,negative
"The App crashes again and again, think the developer for to give it the testing team, and push it to live. I'll download the next public release.",negative
Doesn't have dark mode on android...the basic feature nowadays. Cannot open Help Centre. Terrible. Plz bring dark mode then i might start using it.,negative
"App constantly crashing when trying to comment on threads, also whenever tagging an account it's just crashes straight away. Huawei P20 Pro.",negative
"It's not even working just flashes texts and images evertime I scroll making it pathetically tough to use. For me, solve this glitch and take 5 stars that's all 🙌🏼",negative
"First make this app to adapt themed icons for Android 13 (Google Pixel) and INSTAGRAM TOO.... Please sort out the Home Page. I want similar home feed like twitter (Following and For You). Dont make this home feed like Instagram Home Feed, full cluter. Threads need what is trending right now, '#' has no value right now",positive
"If you don't have an Instagram account already, you cannot even login to this app! There is no option to create an account here. Uninstalled.",negative
very poor app and can't access it. They asked to access via Instagram and can't work. Not convenient app and wasted of time to deal with.,negative
It's good bt it's not better it needs more 1)twitter has editing bt u can't edit here 2)app crashing 3)where is the dm? 4) reloading the page...... I'll keep updating more bt till now I'll give it an 8/10 pls fix it mr Zuckerberg,positive
"I think it's need more things like add music, filters. Btw it's a good social media platform . 🥰",positive
"Great app, awesome UI and UX, slight improvements needed, but it's the first day of Threads and I'm already loving it! :)",positive
No more constant twitter promotions. Wish it was chronological time line so I could receive breaking news and from only those I follow.,positive
Whenever I'm going to open the app.. It's not opening properly... I don't know what happening... Plz fix the bug!!,negative
Crashes like no other!! I could hardly. Post any thing without crashing every single time!!,negative
Worst app tbh as soon as I opened the app all the content was overlapping each other I couldn't even use it.. I installed it again but still the same,negative
"Not bad, just please make it easier to switch accounts. Hate logging in and out to switch accounts.",positive
"It is better to swipe left or right to hide or mute options, and please add a dark theme. Thank you.",positive
Buggy app. Image quality is degrading too much. Uploading video and audio is missing.,negative
I feel that the app coukd be better like having a way to show me threads by the people I follow not just one chaotic mess of tweets and replies but I have hope this will evolve into something brilliant its definitely been a long time coming thank you,positive
haven’t seen any bug untill now but the scrolling animation is too much laggy and it feels too much annoying. this should be 120fps like meta's other app.,negative
The potential is there but it's really bland and buggy. Feels like a early Twitter and is definitely the lesser.,negative
"Smooth, 1st gen, lots of features on the way, but very smooth.",positive
This app shows a glitch on my device whenever I scroll down to read more it just get hang and the entire text become unreadable,negative
Needs translate integration ASAP. No reason in 2023 for it not to be there. Update: Keeps crashing. Bugs galore.,negative
Can't differentiate this app with Instagram app coz they are all the same. I think I gonna uninstall it and go back to my usual Instagram app they binded together.,negative
"This app really needs improvement. Because after opening threads, my instagram account cannot be opened. It always sunddenly closes.",negative
This app is bound to fail. Most of the features are Instagram-centric. This app does not have any unique features.,negative
It's buggy. I opened the app and it immediately lagged and started bugging. I can't do anything.,negative
"i love it so far, although my only problem is that i can't see who i already followed back and who i haven't. but so far so good, feels like a safe space for everyone that needs a social media to be free from toxic people",positive
"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THREADS!!! Once you create an account with threads you are not able to delete just threads but you will be prompted to delete your Instagram account. Additionally, hashtagging topics or items does not work. Wait to sign up until it is a viable platform as of right now it's not worth it.",negative
It's a wonderful social media platform. I can link my Instagram profile and that's amazing. Well move Mark!!,positive
Why is it showing you've been logged out of %1$s.the account owner may have changed the password man I haven't done it I tryed everything uninstalling & clearing cache what more am I supposed to do man just fed up,negative
"Really feels clean and smooth to use, unlike Twitter, but im waiting for the features. If they do, i think this will beat Twitter for sure.",positive
"Pretty good, but need to be able to see like numbers and a greyer theme would be better, current one is jarringly black",positive
A missed opportunity to give more control back to users and empower them to connect; zero options to customize my feed to avoid random content.,negative
App looks and runs great. Only problem I have is that I'm not getting post notifications for profiles I have them enabled for,positive
"So much better than the bird app. They are adding new functionality every week, just give it time.",positive
"I downloaded the application and logged in, but it does not work when using it, strange things occur on the screen",negative
"Just downloaded the app, I just hope we will get the translation option as I follow people who post in languages that I don't read or speak. Thank you",positive
"UI is not coming properly. It's blurry can't read anything. So, please help me to fix it asap",negative
"Better than twitter, i guess. This app will give you intagram-like interface with improved overall appearance than twitter does. Wonderful! Thank u Zuck!",positive
"Can't upload photos, don't know about anything else but whenever I try to upload a photo it crashes without having a chance to post",negative
Fantastic. Love it so far but it needs built in translation please. Thank you so much for a great app.,positive
I have a issue with this app please its verry annoying I use my same account for this app that I use for Instagram however after changing my profile picture on IG and my user name why doesnt it change on Threads also?Please fix the error.,negative
The app is awesom.. but the srolling sucks.. in my device.. sometime before insta had same problem but after an update.. its smooth.. please resolve this..,negative
"Nice user experience, but should be improved. Add the following; 1. Edit button 2. DM button 3. Migrate Instagram followers seemlessly 4. Allow post pinning.",positive
i don't know why is it getting glitch!!! the page does not get loaded and so many pages at a time get opened!!!,negative
"This is way better than Twitter. But, I have an issue, it's not ""smooth"" enough, idk what it is. Also needs dark mode",positive
"Pin posts, chronological timeline of people you follow (very important), activitypub when, unthreading from Instagram in future. Please make this feature full app",negative
This app keeps crashing and states the password may have changed. I cleared my cache on my Samsung Android phone.,negative
"""something went wrong"" flashes followed by a black screen. Happens on 2 Android devices and 1 iOS.",negative
It's ok though but still there is no option to disable the auto-play the videos. Please provide an option for this.,negative
I experience random crashes sometimes when I click on the view replies button on a thread. Everything else is perfect,positive
"Good start. But the algorithm pushes a bit too many ru$$ians, and the app crashes a bit",positive
Not to bad. So much unwanted content in the feed. But very few scam/phishing attempts so far.,positive
It's missing some core features. But it's not full of fascists. Looks better than Twitter too,positive
"I hate Twitter with passion, but this one is so good and very interactive, my first few hours on the app I was surrounded with comedy and every content I needed, welldone Mark Zuckerberg",positive
Can you give a like button !! More accessible or by a gesture like Instagram. By double tapping the post...,positive
"This has been a fantastic v1.0 experience. App is stable, easy to understand, and has been fun to use.",positive
Wooooooow I love the original Instagram but this is a miss. Twitter has state of the art specs that threads has a long way to achieve,negative
"Was a great app for the first year, seems to have a lot of bugs but I believe it has potential. and am the first to review it🤞🏼",positive
"Not good, it requires an Instagram account, totally unsafe, your public opinion linked to you cellphone number, your personal information made public.",negative
It's need improvement as It is very slow to check followers and it takes very much time to upload image or video and don't show percentage of upload in notication in ui,positive
Not even used a single second properly after installing. Too much glitch. Nothing is visible clearly. Please do something,negative
i have an issue while seeing the data. contacted for support through given mail address but no response...... still waiting to see hiw was the application,negative
Excellent app. But try to make media autoplay optional. It consume lots of data.,positive
It's good. You should have a way to stop videos auto playing especially when using mobile phone data.,positive
Doesn't support all kinds of phones/versions on Android platform. The UI is unstable...,negative
"FIRST REVIEW ON THREADS ever. Interface wise it looks similar to Instagram, yet to understand the purpose, will update you soon one I use it, FIRST Rew",positive
Very great up! Theres a little bugs but it runs smoothly! Very very smooth. More updates please!,positive
Can't open a new account. You can only use an instagram account which I don't want. This is not an independent app.,negative
Can't sign up without an Instagram account. Not signing up to that rubbish app again. Will stay with the real Twitter quite happily.,negative
"Hi dev team I downloaded this app, and I have been trying to login with ig as requested but it always fails saying there's a problem trying to be fixed. What's the problem?",negative
If you launch this app to compete the twitter then need to work hard ... After spending 30 minutes I found this app boring from logo to interface ... Near to me this app is only for gathering info nothing else ... This is a new way to find People's at one forum ... Twitter is far away from Threads ... Threads logo has threatening feels ... Scary 😳,negative
"I think it's very good for us bts army because we can share or know about bts information,chats, voting's notice etc.... And it's very good for knowing every small details about bts or any other k-pop group... 🙂",positive
"i think its an great app but lot of room for improvement. I hope you guys will add amazing futures in it like dm, hastags more and more feep up the good work.",positive
Glitch is one word for this. Couldn't use and explore the app due to shaking screen that pops up while scrolling.,negative
Works seamlessly for me with no errors. Quick easy access to the functions I use most often.,positive
"Uploads are failing, automatic 1:1 cropping of photos, cannot choose other folders than the camera's default folder",negative
"It was released 14 hours ago and I haven't noticed any major bugs, it has a very good Ui and very simple to use. Glad to be in the first 100k users",positive
i don't like home page. i just want to see my following content and theirs related. and more things please update privacy setting and translate setting.,negative
"Finally, a worthy competitor for Threads. Not that Meta is that much better either, but real competition is good competition. Hope this app succeeds to put Twitter back on their feet.",positive
"When i upload a video, i dont see a sound button for some android user, please fixed it. Overall its great app",positive
"Needs improvement while scrolling for older Android devices (Android 7) , Need a Seperate dark mode toggle.",negative
What a drama Because one app not start without another app. Mean that we cannot login without instgram. If instragram not open with out wattsap and .......... how long chain if this way.....,negative
Twitter copy but with few updates and different name that's all not good app crashes alot and nothing new or exciting just an app to cover your phone memory better to stick with old apps and play games,negative
"Super cool so far. Looking forward to them adding search, hashtags, and better feeds. So far so good!",positive
It's a total copy of Twitter. Infact Twitter has more features than threads like you can save photos in Twitter but this feature is not available in threads.,negative
"same algorithms, same content so nothing new. when all meta use same algorithms across their social media what's the point of adding another.",negative
"Excellent app, user-friendly, good user interface, easy access 👌 👍 😀. This new space is the less anticipated but best platform ever. The engineers ♥️ 😳 😍 ❤️ are wow 👌 👏 😍 👍",positive
It's very glitchy that I can't see things properly. It's all repeated and stacked on eachother whenever I scroll.,negative
"I would give it a 4 star bcz it's overall a good experience, but I hope it doesn't allow trash like they did with FB and Instagram 🙏 please maintain it standard",positive
I literally just installed this app and it won't even let me open it. It says the app is updating right now to try again later. How is the app updating if I literally just downloaded it?,negative
"Good, but I just wish there was an easier way to access specific folders in your gallery, or post GIFs.",positive
First of all it's great tbh of course it needs some work to be done but it's very new and u can report anything and they fix it fast how far it goes for me as a new app it's amazing,positive
Has potential to dethrone a big rival. I hope it does. But please introduce a translation function.,positive
Nothing special just copied some features from Twitter. It would be better If Zuck also copy hashtag and trending feature from Twitter. I am disappointed because of this🤬,negative
"We need a translate button just like the instagram did. I got a trouble to know the meaning of somebody's threads. He speaks japanese any way, i speak javanese, completely incomprehensible. So please add those button.",positive
"Why does this even exist? It's literally the same as my instagram feed; same people, same accounts, same posts... for what? I already have instagram. Also the terms are extremely invasive of personal info. No thanks! Uninstalled.",negative
This app is impressive. But if you put the setting like ig following and favourites. It would be amazing.,positive
"It's decent but why use data form Instagram Even if you have more followers from Instagram but moving to threads mean you probably have to start at square one, no limits here.",positive
"Not bad. It's a hybrid of Instagram and Twitter. So far so good, interested to see the reputation this app builds.",positive
Kinda Clean UI Better Than Twitter but needs a bit more updates too make it Twitter level....maybe add chats and input stories and maybe a space update which was in Twitter. And for love of god pls do NOT ADD ADS IN THIS LET IT BE THIS CLEAN UI,positive
This is really good just not like Twitter! I really loved the animation while opening the specific image on Threads!,positive
"It's taking 24-48 hours to get notification for posts from people I follow. Also it needs a following feed, without it the app is useless.",negative
All the pages are overlapping for me and too many bugs..please look into this matter and fix it.Thankyou.,negative
Literal rip off of something that's better already. This is a clandestine safe space akin to qanon tards. A liberal blue hair safe space. No thanks. I'll stick to twitter which finally had balance.,negative
"Still trying to hanging with #strings, it will be too early to sail with #threads #java By the way #fb is also started with poor features where orkut used to rock - where is the future now? Didn't like this version of T",negative
"I've been using from couple days... it's found good...Sometimes little lagging is there while loading/opening threads apart from that, all feels okay....cheers to the team :)",positive
"It gives you the option to follow people, but your feed will continue to display any post from any user on the platform making following people completely pointless",negative
"Can't search specific topic here. No trending topic, means hard to follow the life-trend with this platform. I only able to see random posts from people.",negative
I absolutely love it so far. I'm still gonna experiment with uploading pictures but so far it's so much better than Twitter.,positive
"Copycat of Twitter, lacks innovation, redundant n huge privacy issues. App crashes. Going back to Twitter. Support innovation NOT theft!",negative
Excellent so far! Really enjoying it. Looking forward to upcoming updates and meaningful conversations!,positive
It's app little bit good but they many bug's like ishu and also .. big link with Instagram. we don't want to link thread on Instagram.,negative
Amazing experience so far but it really needs some basic stuff like gifs etc. I really hope we see more updates soon.,positive
Loving the app so far alot better than twitter even though their are less features the community is alot better and growing is easier and it is refreshing to have a twitter competitor definitely recommend,positive
"It just launched today, I would say it's not better than Twitter but i see it easily becoming a great rival to it probably in the next few months, until now i would say it's pretty good :)",positive
"If you're looking for a private, personal social media app for your closest friends, then Threads is the app for you. Download it today!",positive
Good app. The reason for the missing star is searching function only works about half the time.,positive
"The feed is essentially ""For You"" from Twitter. I only want to see posts from people I follow. Also, customization options would be nice.",negative
"It doesn't supports multiple accounts,I can't switch to a different accounts like I can on Instagram by double tapping on my profile.",negative
"Full of recommendations and not the people I'm following, no chronological timeline. Is this a joke? Make a real app. Deleting until fixed.",negative
Unstable. Not able to even read anything. Screen gets blurr and cannot get stable.,negative
I love this app already. I don't need to create another account all I so is use my insta account and I can still follow the same people and it's straight forward easy to use,positive
The application was not working well.when I was it's showing nothing just scraching.not proper working.very bad experience.better to use Instagram...,negative
"APP has glitched my insta, Cant even log on my account anymore on the mobile app. it keeps crashing Where the hell is the fix for this?",negative
"This app feels like I am using Diet or sugar free version of twitter, it feels so bland. The app is so desperate that it keeps recommending me out of touch content. I really gave this an honest try, but it just feels so disgusting. The majority of the posts that I saw were people bashing the thread app and its logo. Now I will delete this app in peace, and so I won't have any FOMO.",negative
I rubbish this application. Zuckerberg comes up with applications which are not secure. Thread is just as good as thrush. Very useless app. Anyway I'm a First Kenyan to write this fact,negative
Love how there's no ads ... yet. Reminds me of old chat rooms in the 90s. It'll get better!,positive
"Not working smoothly, no option to login with email, it should be separately signup option without Instagram. Feed not working fine..",negative
"The app is continously crashing, I can only like or reblog, not write or post on my own, everyone is bringing drama from Twitter or posting about it and I see Threads is trying to be a mix of Tumblr and Twitter 😒🙄 Those of us who've been on Tumblr since '09. can't care much for it.",negative
Just getting the initial experience. everything is going well at the moment. There will be more changes and hopefully good changes,positive
"I really like this feature! Of course, coming from Twitter, I'd like to see an explore page or a hastag page!",positive
"almost good, just need more features like gif supported, gallery pick, and smoother experience in android based phone",positive
"I dont know why, but i could imagine your logo to be rainbow line (matching instagram) on black instead of white line on black background.. but white on black is pretty too☺️",positive
Need multi-account switching ASAP. Something similar to the native Instagram build is ideal. 👌🏾,positive
"Smooth and easy to interact with. Every one is friendly lol, I hope it stays that way!!!",positive
Enthusiastic beginning but somehow it feels like Instagram revamped. If only it is possible to reshape it...,positive
Seems great. Still a long process to greatness. Please fix the notifications. I want my Woj and Shams alerts.,positive
"Twitter Wannabe. Please, at least provide something different. This is just a cheap copy of Twitter. Elon does it better. It's too funny that Meta is actually just copy pasting Twitter. Cheap copy. Weak. Useless. Nothing new. Where are the new innovative ideas. Boring and childish behaviour from a huge company just copy pasting another companies ideas. Laughable 3 thumbs down 👎",negative
"It's still new and fun. Expecting more features. It's a knockout on Twitter. I guess, so",positive
"Good app, a challenge for twitter. Only 1 thing to improve in this app is to find nearby or same city and state people for suggestion list",positive
Very poor nothing new on it still Twiter much better and far away from this app.. I think there must be a new and smart concept to attract users.,negative
At this current form I am liking it. The interface is nice. Looks fantastic. Hopefully it will be better than Twitter.,positive
Major features are missing - 1. No hashtags 2. Search only brings back accounts to follow...it should show relevant posts. 3. No trending,negative
"Its really good alternative for Twitter. Would love to have features like pinning the thread , continue the thread after posting . This would be a real help if they could bring features like this",positive
The app is very buggy and the UI elements overlap on one another when scrolled.,negative
"Already better than the blue one, It is a great app nice to use doesn't consumes data, Download, Join and Thank me later. A Thread🤌🏼🥹",positive
Bring in switch accounts like Instagram. Remove numbering in Instagram even though it can be hidden. Do something creative!,negative
"I deleted my instagram account years ago when facebook acquired it. I don't want to create one to use this app. Not to mention, my preferred handle is currently squatted. Anyways. Good luck.",negative
"Not Like Twitter, not even closer to it. You should bring something different from Twitter. It feels like we are using a copy.",negative
Nice app. I didn't see many features yet and didn't see an option to add few accounts. It didn't get all my accounts from IG,positive
The home screen just loads a blank black screen not matter how many people I follow. I thought it would at least load news threads day one.,negative
"Love the app, but it crashes randomly when I try to post comments. Anyone got any ideas on how to fix this?",negative
No Translation Feature. I understand it was being rushed out but thus needed to be available immediately.,negative
"the apps not support on old device, have so many glitch on screen while ""scroll up and down"" and change to other panel button.",negative
Very bad experience 😕 all texts are shaking. At first fixed the problem and then realise again 😤,negative
"The app is nice and simple. I just have a concern, I hope the Threads that will appear in my feed is from the people that I followed so that it'll make sense. Bcs what's that point in following someone if I can see Threads in my feed from people that I don't follow. I hope you'll have an update for this. Thank you.",positive
App is lagging in my device(redmi y2)! Home screen content shattering so badly on display! Please fix this bug!,positive
"In light of the recent restrictions and policies implemented on Twitter, the emergence of Threads appears to be a strategically advantageous move. The timing of its arrival aligns well with the current landscape, leading me to strongly believe that Threads has the potential to surpass Twitter within a few months.",positive
"Everything on the internet is being connected to each other whether it's an app or a person, just waiting for the end of all these scenarios! Fri, 7Jul,2023.",positive
"So far, a solid alternative to Twitter, can't wait for new features and fixes that'll truly take Threads to the next level in social media",positive
"Meh, same forced showing of celebs, sports, and people you don't follow that Instagram does. If you could remove suggested content it would be four stars.",negative
It would be great if there are: 1) enable searching for keywords 2) has 'media' column on profile feed 3) show the number of people repost on a post,negative
The app is fun to use but it keeps crashing. I have the same problem with Instagram too.,negative
You could have added an option on Instagram to post a thread instead of copying an entire app to introduce one small option.,negative
"There was no need of a new Twitter like app, instead Meta could've integrated the features of Twitter in Instagram itself just like they did for features copied from Snapchat, Pinterest, Discord, Tiktok etc 🙂",negative
There's an error when searching and in the following tab. The threads also cannot be translated.,negative
"The text is not large when viewing a single thread. Also, when I want to exit Threads, I wish to keep my Instagram account.",negative
Meta team you just provide one platform to login just Instagram what can i do if i didn't want to sign up through Instagram there will be other options like sign in through Google account Facebook etc.,negative
"Not bad so far, the only thing I had an issue with is you can't have more than one account right now. But I do love it so far not terrible. Credits go to meta for this one.",positive
Some of us do not want to use Instagram. Why is it necessary to access Threads via Instagram? Why there is no alternative registration/login without Instagram?,negative
It's just fun and easy to use compared . personally it helps have some feed for my Instagram so yay threads I would encourage anyone to download this,positive
no translation option and no chats. Please add these features .a lot of blue check accs in the home that are not in my interests .,negative
"amazing!! twitter would be cry. btw pls make a new feature.. like download media, dark mode, views count, tab following and explore, trendings/topics and hastags.",positive
"Give me translator man! Our community in Instagram is beyond borders.... Now we are having trouble to understand what our followers say! This is an emergency need 🦺 Overall, an amazing app 👍",positive
Unable to receive notifications of followed people's posts as I do with Twitter! Even with turning all app notifications on and pressing the BELL botton of each profile I follow!,negative
The app is soo bad don't install it because if u install it and then u wanna to remove ur account or the app you will remove the instagram too automatically so if you install it you can't remove it and twitter>>>>>,negative
"I'm unable to upload any photos, app keeps on crashing, I'm using z fold 4 latest OS available.. 😞",negative
I absolutely love the Threads app It’s a great way to stay connected with my close friends and share ideas and trends through text,positive
Fails to upload so often. Can't easily search topics. Hopefully thus is due to the crazy uptake and it improves soon,negative
What's the point of launching it as a mobile-only app? Stealing data? Lack of a proper web app is a major turn off for me.,negative
"Amazing app overall, but still is missing some important additons, for example, a feed for only followers/topics/better search...",positive
Please introduce data saving. This app uses way too much data just for tweets. I don't need videos to load or high quality images,positive
"Definitely new. Fairly limited, but similar to Twitter and I'm sure more features will come over time.",positive
"I started by searching “Threads” in the app store, scrolled through some small apps unfortunately also named Threads (RIP to those, inevitably), and clicked on Threads by Meta. The app asked me to connect my Instagram account to sign up, and I switched over from my personal to my professional page – sorry, readers, I will not be revealing my finsta here. Et voilà, I became a Threads user.",positive
The images and clips are not working to save on gallery So that would be great to download it to the device,negative
"Love the interface, but can't get audio to work on videos using Android.",positive
Worst app I have ever seen..when i open this application it shows the multiple errors..many glitches in this application.. don't download it,negative
"The app is gorgeous, but I cannot have dual accounts like instagram that I can transfer between them easily.",positive
Needs a following-only home page or a better home suggestion algorithm. Maybe it just hasn't learned what content I like.,positive
"So far so good. Seems like Twitter but, i think it's better, especially when Twitter forced its users to pay for twitter blue.",positive
"5 star +😩, this app is so damn good, just some few touches like editing pictures before posting need to be added.",positive
The first few days it worked well until today. The app keeps shutting down & fails to open. Disappointed,negative
"This app has been amazing so far, Amazing UI, Good User Experience and absolutely seamless to use! Hoping that this will be a boon for upcoming creators!",positive
"Getting ""Sorry something went wrong. Try again."" error on all tabs except the post tab(works fine).",negative
App has huge bugs.. whom i don't even know or don't follow they post is coming to my feed and its irritating. Kindly fix this.,positive
"Well, it's one of the new best apps that you can share your expression on, but still needs so many features.",positive
Disappointing. People flood it with photos and videos anyway. I wish it was just text based. This isn't a text based social network. It's just another social network.,negative
"The truth is that it is very good and has a very good design, but when I try to publish a thread with a photo, it takes me out and tells me that the app is not working",positive
"I can't see replays on any posts and activity tab is also unavailable. I just see the message ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again""",negative
Something is very wrong. I get just screens of tiny symbols and the occasional video post? So bizarre.,negative
"I'd be happy to help you with feedback on captions! Please provide me with the captions you'd like me to review, and I'll do my best to assist you.",positive
Great kick off expect experience and features will continue to improve best part no ads (yet) and highly engaged community.,positive
"App doesn't work. Enter username and password and get ""something went wrong, please try again"". Can't do anything or see anything other than this message.",negative
"Because Threads is part of Instagram, it shares the same TOS. This means that nudity is banned, which makes me happy. I had enough of all of the porn bots on Twitter, so Threads was the smartest option. I love just how much better this app is over Twitter.",positive
I don't see any feature that will attract me to stay. Clearly they are trying to copy twitter but without success.,negative
"The app is not fully optimised, if you go to upload a photo or video then it will crashed.",negative
Can not use the app. All texts overlap each other; can't read anything. Please fix it.,negative
Nice app like Twitter but with better ui and ux and the reason for 4 stars was please add switch account option I can't log out log in every time I want to switch.,positive
"Only algorithmic feed, no chronological. Feed shows accounts that are not followed. Garbage app. Dead on arrival.",negative
Can't create the account. Instagram account setup doesn't work from Android phone. Bad initial experience.,negative
I am not getting any new posts while on home icon. My feed has the same posts that he had about a week ago with nothing new added.,negative
"I wasnt getting notifications for my messages, I turned off this app and I started to get audio notifications...",negative
"So far the app is good. I'm loving it. So addictig. But I request, put some ""see translation"" like what you did on Instagram. :))",positive
"i honestly think this can beat twitter, that app have become the worst. i fully understand the concept of this one. keep it up!",positive
"Good app but few features lack like automated bot, ai bots and also hastags there should be an extra tab for discover. Thanks btw.",positive
"Def needs more color. Plain white reminds me of isolation room. 😐And can you allow editing of posts, please. 😔",negative
Got app but it kept closing and refused me to set up an account no mater what I tried the app flagged me and that made no sense! I found another way and off I was made one post will wait and see if it gets noticed. As far as Facebook I don't use it much but probably more than I with threads will wait and see if they actually flag me for my one post ? Surprise surprise I finally decided to do a thread post and bam it never posted I didn't like Facebook much hate Twitter being run by Elon Musk.,negative
"Best of Meta's app! Amazing experience so far with it. And better, than Twitter in UI/UX consistency!",positive
I like it but i think it needs a little more to it. Im not going to uninstall it i believe this app like instagram and facebook could do really good,positive
"When this app is launched Within the 2 hours I have downloaded it, It's amazing and one of most beautiful thing which I likes more is that it can link with Instagram both are good aaps Thanks Mark Zuckerberg 😊",positive
"Hi Meta Team, Threads app is very good. Its very easy to use and understand. But here i'm not able to use # tags. Could you pls add this features?? So we will be use #Tags in the our post.",positive
I'm not a fan of Instagram. I have to sign in with Instagram? Maybe their should be a Facebook option.,negative
"Worst app, I can't delete my account, the only way is deleting my Instagram account. Please take a step and solve this kind of ugly problem!!! WORST APPLICATION!",negative
"I'm very disappointed about this app. It's not working good, Everything seems ghosting. Contents are overlapping",negative
This is so friendly interface and easy to post our opinions.But we need extra features for example pinning...,positive
"It's very nice love the interface I just have one complaint and it's for the home feed To be more of people we're following, seeing a lot of random threads other than this it's Amazing",positive
Won't let me create an account. I don't want to be on Instagram. If this is a Twitter replacement just let me sign up to it!,negative
its pretty creative but it's crashing!! ill still give it a five stars and ill update my review along the way if necessary,positive
"The app GUI is crashing, cant use it. Needs improvement, device specific updates n bugfixes.",negative
Terrible doesn't even work properly and I don't like the regional segregation. Just bad copy of another bad social media app.,negative
Am the first to write a review on Mark Zuckerberg new app...wow😂😂 I had early access to it in the last few day and I think its great. When u open it u prompt to login with Instagram You keep ur same user name and you can follow the people you are already following on Instagram if u wish....or u can recreat if u wish. U can add a bio automatically import from ig... At a very first glance it feels familiar They not inventing the wheel here. The design is minimum it clean and attractive,positive
𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘀 doesn't work on my phone. It's shaky and unstable. Hardly can I see anything without blurring.,negative
"Simple ui and great in-app experience.. Loved it❤️.. It would be nice if next update includes: Data saving Mode, DM, trending, Hashtags...",positive
"No option to see only the people you are following in your threads, lots of random people and groups showing instead.",positive
"The app screen doesn't update and gets all clogged up, completely unusable.",negative
Terrible! I scroll and all text and images leave trails and it just stuck there!,negative
"Seems very smooth, so far I don't see any bugs! Already working better than Twitter.",positive
"please add polls/edit text, also improve the algorithm, i followed many people but i still get so many random threads that don't match my interest or anything from random people",positive
It's crashing every 5 mins i use it. Quite annoying. Edit-- now it's not even starting I am using nothing phone1,negative
"It's worse than Facebook. Only random posts in the feed, nothing relevant. Plus I don't see posts of the accounts I follow. Waste of time",negative
Not straight forward. Not clear where one post or thread starts and whee it ends. Very simple background. Needs work,negative
The seamless integrations between Threads and Instagram was such a smart move. Creators would be WAY less motivated to.,positive
A) we need a character count B) we need hashtags to actually work C) we need to be able to pin a post to the top of our profile. D) we need to be able to save media. Everyone shares and saves media. Wtheck. E) also we can't mute accounts? Sorry but I don't wanna block every single person out there. I use this for one thing and one thing only. And because it's new there are THOUSANDS of ppl idk showing up on my feed. Sorry but this won't ever replace twitter. 🤣🤣,negative
Login / registration fails. 2FA Codes are never sent via email or sms. I tried for 40 minutes. Dreadful first run experience.,negative
"Urgently needs a button to switch between accounts, it's a real pain to log in/out every time !",negative
"Required to have Instagram account as well? BS.... regardless if from I-Gram, should'nt be required to have an additional bloatware app.",negative
Yeah this app is kinda of wonky on my device... Theres an issue with the graphics when i scroll or change tabs kinda like runny ink or smudging of the pen,negative
It's a copy. Should have its own interface and features . Something new should have been introduced!,negative
The aap is although very good.... But the refreshment takes a long time... And overall experience is good enough.,positive
Better than Twitter 😀. It took me a while to find the app because there is a different app called Threads. I suggest you add a link on Instagram for downloading this app...,positive
The UI is nice and smooth. Like the integration with Instagram,positive
I only want to see the threads from people I follow and not people I don't know. Videos automatically playing and I can't turn them off.,negative
This isn't working properply... The screen is dragging all way down and content is overlapping tooo... Someone needs to fix this,negative
I think it's a great app. I think the best thing about it is that there's no direct messaging and at least right now no ads. Right now give it a try. I think you will be happy with it.,positive
Love it! It's like old school Twitter which I love. Everyone is happy and having fun. And where I know that won't last forever ...it's just so nice. We needed this!,positive
After installing this app my Instagram and thread both have stopped and not working. Not even showing log in page.,negative
I liked this app. This app interface is relexable. Like trending option comes on twitter same trending option should also come in this,positive
"Shortly:Twitter better, more specific:small user base, app crashes quiet frequently, interface is too simple",negative
Seamless. But it's having an error right now. Maybe the birds are flocking over here.,positive
"GREAT APP!!! DEFINITELY AN UPGRADE FROM DYING TWITTER. NEGATIVE COMMENTS WILL COME BASED ON ZUCK AND ELON DIFFERENCES, ATTACK CAMPAIGNS, BUT NOT THE APP PROBLEM.",positive
Bad functionality and lacking features. Can't choose who I want to see. Poor knockoff of twitter.,negative
"Meh, it's just a bootleg twitter. There is nothing special and too many brands showing up on my feed. I'm going to stick with Twitter for now.",negative
"I can Easily share posts , videos, and Ideas, Outstanding app. But Minor Changement UI . And People Accounts. Add more Functional Things",positive
Application is not working on Redmi Note 5 pro . When we open likes page it occurs that home page is glitched to like page .Need to fix it.,negative
I want to like it. But it only let me posts pics for one day before going back to crashing every time I try....,negative
Stop showing me pages I don't follow. I don't follow them because I don't want to see them. Also.... Chronological order please. We all HATE your trash algorithm. 0/5 so far. Fix it.,negative
Most disgusting app. Twitter is far far better than this app. Wasted my time! It's just a text version of Instagram.,negative
The app is lagging each time I scroll it's blurs I can barely see.... Different post on each other. Pls this has to be changed,negative
"threads is horrible 😭 I can't see anything, all the letters r mixing up I can't see a single world. Whenever I open this app it acts weirdly, like so crazyyy!! So messy",negative
"Need more feature such as search by words, hashtags, an actual working top/latest search, etc then this app will be even more perfect",positive
I make a better app name of this : E passport Online. This app w Help you to make or create passport. Also you wll get passport so fast. Thank you.,negative
After 1 day use the app seems to be perfect and smooth like insta and watsapp. I think it will be a better version of Twitter 😜.,positive
"Give some editing options. Like crop image, filters etc... And option to edit Threads. Otherwise its FUn.",positive
"Really nice apps, it's free service will skyrocket in popularity, I urge you to update the system constantly to make it better, and best of luck..!🙂❤️",positive
"Unlike Twitter , UI is very good and no clutter. Basic and easy functionalities",positive
"Exceptional, this app would be far better than Twitter in coming years and for the fact that it's synced to Instagram is awesome",positive
So.. it looks good for now.. I do have one suggestion.. we need a translation button for us fans who are following international idols and actors.. so just 4 stars for now,positive
Just wonderful. Except the suggestions. They should tailor feeds to language preferences.,positive
I am try login to this app but all time error show . I am unable to login in any way for these three days. Please solve this issue.,negative
"Nice interface and user experience Perfect substitute for twitter, Kindly work on thread translation.",positive
"I love this app, way fewer spam bots than most, great community. Needs a few more features and that's it.",positive
"Everytime I try to make a post with a picture the app crashes, sorry but I can't rate it any higher",negative
The app has been amazing since the first day. 😍 and the people who said it crashes 0r overlaps threads and stuff are the hater's,positive
"This Social Media, is photograpy friendly... I really recommend it, the algorithm is unique and friendly..",positive
I miss twitter. I don't like the data sharing and all that zukeeberg does. I wish my Instagram account was not linked to threads. I'm disgusted! How can people be so horrible 🤮,negative
Good We would like to add clips of the reals and more features and means of trend such as Twitter It is rather excellent,positive
"like the design, maybe give us some recommendation of account in our interest, somekind like explore in instagram so the feeds can be a bit more interesting to scroll 🤔",positive
My threads app is glitched. It is not working at all. I hope Instagram team will fix this problem soon.,negative
I just downloaded the app and I want to upload pictures it's showing error that I need to download the newest version 😕 so annoying,negative
"Its a perfect glitch app, i tried to reinstall but same problem. Just when i scroll down it starts glitching!",negative
I can't get rid of posts from people I Do Not Follow hoarding my page and I cannot put things in chronological order. Also this app just kindof sucks. I'm not using this,negative
Astounding app! Everything is so easy to use and is in one place. Keep the great work going!,positive
It's just ok. It definitely isn't Twitter. No hashtags and bio character length isn't as long as Twitter. Feels like a beta version.,negative
It may change the ecosystem of Twitter but will take some time.It's fun and enjoyable again we will waste some time.,positive
"No organization. I cant find the accounts i follow. You know what this app reminds me of.....oh yea, TWITTER!! You are not ready. Pull the plug and go back to the drawing board.",negative
The UI completely glitches out moments after the app is opened. Unusable.,negative
I cant see what I'm typing. The keyboard comes up and the text bar thing is under the keyboard. So annoying.,negative
Been great so far! However I can't seem to reinstate hidden badges on Instagram...is there a way to toggle this function?,positive
Everything on the app gets hazy after i enter into it. I cant even see anything. It perfectly installed bt doesnt work,negative
The email account I used for my threads account can't open the app again and also since I opened the threads account my Instagram has not been responding like how it used to be,negative
"Won't let me log in, error sending video identification (I have fiber) despite inputting my 2pa. Day 2: no email reset for access to my account",negative
It's really very amazing... It's a new app so yaa it does require some improvements but it's good overall... Keep improving.,positive
"Love the experience so far, add dark mode and a way to save posts to view later.",positive
UI breaking all times and leads to infinite UI changes like old windows dragging functionality,negative
"Not perfect, but a lot of promise for the future especially compared with the brain dead bird app",positive
Just added one feature of tweet on Instagram app and made a new app Why should I use another app when I can get all the features on Instagram I think this should have been the feature upgrade on Instagram rather than new app,negative
"Urdu is a very widespread language which is written, read and spoken all over the world. 1. You should add Urdu language support for South Asia region. 2. Kindly add increase font size option in threads's settings. I hope my point will be considered.",negative
"my app is crashing, always shaging when i try to scroll the app, i think it is a bug. will change my rating when already fixed",positive

"I've given 5 🌟 for a 30 minutes, find out the app keeps on stopping when png images uploaded. But now 4 🌟 until it's resolved.",positive
"Your app is good, almost perfect. We aldo need a place to chat with our followers like Instagram. Please we need it. Thanks Zukky",positive
So far so good... I just hope that the save photo feature will be included soon and also hope that it won't get toxic lol,positive
"Amazingly beautifu and user friendly app, just jumpt in hope there are no bumps ahead and it's gonna be a smooth ride.",positive
"Would give a 5 just cus its a good alternative to Twitter but waiting for them to add a trending tab, DMs, bookmarks and to be able to view my likes!",positive
"Why Meta why? We already had Twitter. This is another redundant app. Facebook trynna literally copy each & everything from its competitors. Needless to say, the absurd logo looks like some kind of pubic hairs seen in WCs",positive
All the texts get mixed up and I can't read. I can't use the app at all. It needs more development.,negative
"Being a Software Engineer, I felt this is very interesting but it still need more improvements and also need to make better from user side.",positive
"Needs a following tab, the feed algorithm is hot garbage. Every time I open the app I'm assaulted by 20-30 posts of pure cringe before I see a single thread from someone I actually follow.",negative
"Perfect 👍 Only one thing that is left is Just add the trending feature and that’s it ,it would be the end of Twitter 🙌",positive
"Booted it up twice, both times it asked me to turn notifications on. Yeah, nah.",negative
Very bad app i just download it and login on it but after that it start laging at massive level there is nothing to see properly on screen worst app i see in my life🤬,negative
Great start to a social platform. Only issue is the home feed is clogged with celebs and brands trying to gain traction by spamming posts. Hopefully this gets resolved soon,positive
"Why anyone would give this more than one star given how bad it is? And I don't care if it's just ""starting out."" They had a chance to make this good at launch, KNOWING their competition at twitter, take the good parts from twitter and IMPROVE on it. But they didn't. Also considering this is owned by FB/Instagram, I'm not expecting this to get any better. Already bad enough I see posts from people THAT I DON'T FOLLOW, instead of the people I DO follow. So much for a ""twitter killer.""",negative
"The compulsory link to Instagram, which is linked to Facebook. Well makes unusable to those who don't want to be part of every part of metas empire",negative
"My account gets automatically logged out of Instagram when I sign in for threads nd vice versa, it gets logged out of threads when I use Instagram. How to fix?",negative
"The app is cool But I couldn't access my photo folders It's a newly launched app, so there's still room for improvement",positive
"Too much, noise still primitive, can't filter my front page, .....for a multi billion dollar company, u can do better.",negative
Can't upload any photos. It says failed to upload. I thought this was an Instagram app? Can't upload photos?,negative
Full of bugss as soon i open the app the screen starts to stutter how can u release a app that is not even in proper state of working,negative
"This app is terrible. Nothing works correctly, even on a S23 Ultra. Very useless. Not enjoyable whatsoever.",negative
The app has a cool UI 💯..I would suggest you add a feature that enables users to crop photos before posting,positive
"the app is good but there are many options and updates we needed like chat option , trending threads , report account , there should be no vulgar videos etc",positive
It's not working properly. When I try to scroll it starts glitching and I can't see anything.,negative
I loved this app so much but iam having one problem and this problem is that the app doesn't have dark mode in the settings like instgram,positive
It is working well as expected. I hope features that are missing will be added like DMs.,positive
Its exceptional though it lacks a DM section. And it could really use a for you and following selector to differentiate threads,positive
"I wish the ""followers"" were sorted according to the Time they were followed. It's just sorted randomly, making it crazy scattered",negative
"Please I can't go dark mode in the app even though I use dark mode on Instagram, hope you fix this.(android user) Also put pinned post and photo section to desiminate things",negative
"It just looks like Twitter but not as expensive provided there but it's a beginning, I hope for better.",negative
I now installed and logged in but there is a bug inside the app looks the screen not stable and the writing shakes. So can't control it.,negative

Clean and sleek user interface. Easy to read and fast.,positive
The screen look shaky once you start scrolling can't even see anything properly. The worst,negative
I love that the team is working hard to keep propaganda and other nonsense off of the platform!,positive

The experience is good so far ...!!! Hope we get editing option on the post .,positive
"threads in my phone not works, if i scroll or move to the menu on the bottom the pictures and inscription are roll up, please help ?",negative
My connected Instagram account is crashing every minute. Absolutely frustrating.,negative
Great so far but video volume is not working...its silent. And please add an edit button! ♡,positive
"I can't see the POST button when I type past my keyboard, even though I haven't exceeded the word or character limit.",negative
The Scrolling is not smooth like other Meta Apps. I have to push the content up hard. Please fix this.,negative
"Enjoyed it the first day, but now I can't even open the app. It keeps crashing whenever I open it.",negative
Content on home is garbage. I need somewhere to see trending topics and things like that for this to be useful.,negative
Please try to upgrade this app I can see that you can't send private message to someone which very wrong how can a social media platforms especially like this no place of private message check even Twitter has place of private message,negative
The app itself it's awesome..but need improvement a little bit.. more features must be included also!,positive
"Okay so the first few hours were fine and I was posting my threads non stop and having fun and gained a follower. But then a after that when I opened the app again it deleted all my THREADS and said "" Sorry, something went wrong. Try again"" and I had no followers , couldn't see my threads because they got deleted and I couldn't see posts on my feed. Very disappointed 😞",negative
"Full of bugs, followers count stuck, can't see others followers, can't see who's not following you, can't complete delete others mention on your thread, Instagram quick access disappeared...",negative
There is no translation option in thread for that reason most of the user can't translate foreign language into english. Mark Zuckerberg please set language translation program in your new threads app.,negative
"1 - we can't delete our account in this without deleting out insta account 2 - Even after removing the number badge on my insta profile several times, it keeps coming back.",negative
I love it already. Simple to use. I think you guys should work on the display names and usernames so we can be able to change the display name anytime we want. Thank you.,positive
"The worst thing about this application is that it is connected to the Instagram account, and this is not a good thing, because you will not be able to delete the account until you delete the Instagram account, and this is bad, but very bad, even worse.",negative
Edit : Thanks for fixing the bug. But pls make a website or a desktop app.,positive
As soon as I opened the app It got registered to my insta account is all good then once opened its having a blurry page wana change that issue please,negative
"Don't Download. After installing Threads and sync with Instagram, Instagram keep crashing and not opening.",negative
Intial release is fine. It's has to improve in editing option to everyone like an insta post.,positive
"the design is absolutely class, it looks really clean, smooth, keep up the good work Meta",positive
This is a good app and it can be able to replace twitter in future 💥. But is has few bugs on it also but regarding this this is a amazing aap,positive
"app is not working properly on my phone, it glitches extremely madly and it doesnʼt let me swipe down without glitching.",negative
"I'm facing glitch in this app. The screen feels jittery and unable to scroll. Giving this 1 🌟 , might change this in the future",negative
"After 6 days use, it's not good so far. After all that noise, Twitter still better.",negative
Something wrong with this app....kindly fix it. I can't use it nicely. Seems have a virus inside on this app....,negative
The app is behaving wierd. It looks like there is a glitch. The scree is shaking and nothing is working.,negative
"Old phone not compatible even if play store said it was compatible on my device, when i scroll it looks like counter strike sky box when you fly out of bound",negative
Feels like an older version of Twitter. Threads on the public feed are somewhat facile. Waiting for more integrations before updating this review.,negative
I'm not satisfy this app because this app blur on my phone screen can you solve this problem because I see this problem in every time in phone I can't understand what can I do on this situation,negative
I like the app. But there is something wrong when I am uploading a pictures. It keeps crashing 🥲🥲,positive
"Frustrating! I don't have, and don't want, an Instagram account, so I can't use the App...",negative
"If I don't have / want an Instagram account so I can't login, that's not acceptable. I am uninstalling the app.",negative
I think it's a great idea that thread has no DM. If it could be kept that way! Besides thie app is cool like that.,positive
"I cannot post photos with videos and cannot post single video or reply with videos. Always failed, please fix ASAP",negative
"Fair- Everytime trying to start a ""thread"" and when I try post or add a photo it kicks me out completely.",negative
"Seems like a good start. Hoping to see more improvements. Overall, solid experience",positive
"I really don't see the point in this app. Also, I really don't like how you can't delete your Threads account without deleting your Instagram..",negative
"Unable to use without Instagram. I don't like Instagram, so I guess I have to go away, and install Twitter instead.",negative
"Although everything is fine but please add the feature of switching accounts in @Threads, an Instagram app, too like that in Instagram",positive
"Guys, this app keeps glitching, META fix this ASAP, cuz the app has great potential and an amazing UI, so please work on it.",negative
HORRIBLE buggy bad wannabe twitter. Drains battery bug. Heats up all devices. Interferes with wifi and mobile network settings. Ignores permission denials. Breaks privacy apps settings. This should be banned and illegal. Horrible. Google play should be ashamed.,negative
"So far I love it..clean interface, 5 minute videos, 500 character limit, import your Instagram details with a few clicks, follow your Instagram followers with one click, the ability to post to mastadom coming..I think Twitter is dead and zuckerberg and Meta have a winner 🏆",positive
So far this app is amazing as a new bie sweet and smooth.. hashtags only seems not to be functioning yet.,positive
"Don't know what's up with the app, when I try replying to someone's thread with a pic. The app just automatically closes.??",negative
It does not work in dark mode of android.screen overlapping each other .fix this glitch ASAP.,negative
I can't upload photos I have no idea why. Please do fix this bug for me so I have more reasons to stay in this app,negative
Main problem with threads is its feeds... It doesn't show from people u follow...kindly allow to show feeds only from people we follow..no translation for different languages,negative
A lot better than Twitter. Runs a lot more smoothly and you don't get the random nudity which is A LOT better.,positive
It should be linked together with IG so we can jump from Thread to Instagram without closing any app to log on another app.,positive
Slow and stopped responding. But moreover just boring. And I don't need Facebook tracking yet another thing about me.,negative
Shows posts from random popular pages I'm not interested in instead of posts for the pages I follow!! Please fix this asap!!,negative
Useless app can't even see single word on screen due to glitch.everything is overlap on each other.,negative
It has glitches on my phone and i have not yet been able to make it work. Overall experience so far 3/10,negative
This app just seems like the lite version of Twitter after the collab with Instagram. Could have been better.,negative
"I really like this application because his interface is really impressed me , this app is very smooth and easy to use",positive
"Those having issues, have issues everywhere else in life. App works fine just as intended.",positive
I dunno what happened but can you bring back my account?? like fr my threads suddenly got disabled and now even my Instagram account was disabled.. seriously I shouldn't have downloaded this app if I know what's gonna happen,negative
I am not downloading this new app. Unless Facebook gives its creators the opportunity to live chat with the administration in any problem. YouTube gives all opportunities to its creators but Facebook doesn't and bans them immediately,negative
The app is phenomenal! Everyone's just so positive. Can't wait to see how it will turn out. Would love to have a translate button on it.,positive
While scrolling the page all the pages are ovearloaded I can't use the app properly it makes bad impression on the app,negative
You can't see the text input window when replying. It is covered by the keyboard making it so you can't see what you are typing.,negative
It is great app since it is not complicated and easy to use without any unnecessary options that hinders your undeniable experience from this app.,positive
"Best Experience so far on social media!! Pls help me on this one. When I post a video, I don't get any audio on it. Pls help",positive
Can't post any pictures. Why can some people post photos but I can't? Definitely reflecting my rating of this app!,negative
I'm really impressed with Threads. It's a great new social media app that I highly recommend.,positive
Installed this on day first of its launch. This app is undoubtedly good but needs a lot of improvements yet. Keep it up.,positive
I wish we couldn't save pictures and videos...use Instagram colors on the repost sign to show a repost was done ...also add trending topics somewhere,positive
Crashes when uploading a picture so what's the point in the app. Shouldn't of rushed getting it out,negative
"accounts i don't follow are showing up instead of people i do follow, the only way to see their posts is to go to their account. fix the app and I'll change my review but i am not happy otherwise.",positive
"As social media aps go, this is awful. You would expect better with all of the trial an error our civilization has had over the last 20 years.",negative
App is full of Bug and glitch Not optimised at all Specifically when phone is set to dark mode,negative
Until now I have not faced any problems regarding its usage and good thing is that it doesn't contain any type of ads on it.,positive
There are many things missing in this app: 1. Trends 2. Search for tweets 3. Direct massage 4. Save option for photos,negative
I will change my rate when: 1- Dark mode works on my app 2- when I only see people I follow in my wall and 3- when I can search for posts instead of only profiles,negative
Too early to say but I like the interface. A bit slow though. Will share more in coming days. Follow @baloch_travelogue,positive
Yo the app doesn't work for days now. Tried re-installing. Everything keeps pasting on top of each other,negative
"I like that it doesn't show like count but number of replies. Social Media is about community, not popularity. Good job Instagram and Meta!",positive
"I know this will get added soon because the app is still new, but having an option to translate threads would be helpful!",positive
Installed and immediately deleted it. App full of bugs. Cheap copy of Twitter. Don't even try this garbage 🤮,negative
"annoying glitch every time I am typing something, the app would suddenly closed and everything I just typed would be gone.",negative
"I had Awesome Experience using, User Interface is simple, No Fake Accounts, Bots Trolls etc.. like on Twitter hope this app will Replace Twitter and Be A Better Alternative.",positive
App has way too many phone permissions. No way to turn off or delete without removing Instagram.,negative
"Buggy on redmi 8, the display is overlapping when i change the tab, same case when i scroll it.",negative
Not good. You just doing copy paste of Twitter layout. do something new if you have otherwise don't waste your time and money.,negative
"Lots of potential here, but it's a bit bare right now in features. I hope you make a separate tab for who you follow.",positive
"Needs work on not logging you out of instagram and vice versa, cos of the constant switching I'm now locked out of instagram and can't log back in",negative
Tooo much glitch at one time. Even I can't use this app when I login and open this app my screen just glitching just fix this issue,negative
Sir it's good but in my phone sir always happening crash problem sir whenever I am opening my threads app always crash happens plz 🙏 solve this problem sir as soon as possible...,negative
"Never thought I would be installing a meta app on my phone but the fumes coming off the cesspool at the original ""internet town square"" is becoming too much.",positive
"I loved this new, Elmo-free social media app until yesterday 13 July, when it started crashing every time I open it.",negative
The experience was not good. It is just second copy of Twitter..it was not expected that u have a app like insta still u are copying others..very dissapointing q,negative
#Threads not a copy of #Twitter it's different from Twitter their is more option than Twitter 500 letter option is on threads and even at a time we can upload 10 photography it's looking good and on 8 to 9 hours it's followers has reached on top of any social media great to have threads Thanks a lot to the whole team of threads and also to Mark Zuckerberg thanks a lot for give world such a beautiful social media apps #Threads,positive
"Very bad experience having till now . Not able to scroll the window it's lagg a lot , please go further and help me out",negative
"Currently unusable, everytime I open threads and scroll up and down, the UIs and Texts keeps multiplying like India's population rate",negative
"Well too Simple to use, yet reponse is good. Glad to know, one of few countries, we are experiencing it now!",positive
"It's not working in Android. When I scroll , display will vibrating. Please fix it as possible as.",negative
Basically Facebook with a different UI. Let's see how long til bots take over this one too.,negative
Very well built. It is generally amazing for a new social media platform. The community is nice and it's generally relaxing,positive
"I hope the security on this app will not be like that of Instagram, easily hacked. Else we will still go back to twitter.",negative
It's really a nice app. Same features as Twitter. It's very interesting and easy to use,positive
3rd day. Suddenly the option ( a good one) to share any thread to insta feed disappears! Not fair. Bring it back asap..,positive
No hashtags so you can't search up what you like & it only works on your phone. Mastodon is superior.,negative
"No dark mode, no cronological order mode, no desktop version, no only followers mode, probably the worse meta app yet, worse than facebook.",negative
"Unless they add a feature to only see threads by those who you follow, or threads they interact with, this app is basically useless.",negative
scrolling is so messed up that the screen becomes unviewable!! why release an app before full testing just to compete with twitter!!!,negative
"More features : like a listening to.., maybe voice note, keep no DM, no Following to count, an edit threads, a translator, no ads please",positive
Definitely pushing an agenda. Very biased and boring. Hoping it gets better.,negative
This app is amazing! I feel it's gon get wayyy better!!! Can't wait for more updates n new features to this app! I'm definitely giving 5 star (day 2 of using).,positive
When I open it on my phone it's like it has a virus or something .. I cant type nor do anything without the screen looking like it's rubbing everything 😔,negative
The app needs more work. It constantly fails to upload upload and barely shows most of my posts and comments.,negative
Loved this new initiative by Instagram the app features are easy to use and the interface is lovable ♥️,positive
"Useless app, since day 1 this app just stuck, I can't even use it properly.. after clear cache this app still glitching..",negative
"Ngl, this app is better than any other social Media apps, u can get access easily, and it's very easy to use. I really liked it 😍",positive
"Great app. Better than Twitter. Neat, and smooth UI, plus media quality is also great.",positive
"Horrible algorithm for feed, shows just randomly anything. Makes no sense at all.",negative
Easy interface but it needs to be accessible by PC like Insta and FB are.,positive
Seems intresting but my feed has too many glitches it says it supports A9 but alphabets in my feed is overlapped overlayed can't read a thing.. 🙁,positive
Threads is the social media app I've been waiting for! It's a game-changer in terms of connecting and sharing with friends.,positive
Can't use it as I don't have an Instagram account. Not interested in Instagram so I'll just stick with Facebook.,negative
"The app's concept is great, but it's full of glitches! Whenever the content in the display changes, the full app becomes glitchy. Even on a small scroll, the problem appears. Let alone some button clicking! Maybe the issue is only applicable for a few type of users. But, please fix the bug. In spite of this app's being great, I have to stay neutral by giving 2 stars is just because of these bugs.",negative
"App won't send verification codes, the AI has also decided I'm trying to create a fake profile. Frustrating",negative
"This app is terrible. Why on earth I am supposed to see what lots of people, I am not following, are writing about? Also, why can't I create an account separate from my Instagram account?",negative
"If Meta wanted to go head to head with Twitter, they should have given us a better quality app. Hidden words do not work and the home feed is nothing but the same threads all day. I'm still seeing the same threads from 6 days ago. Twitter is the superior app.",negative
"The Ui is minimal, clean and aesthetically pleasing. Connecting your IG with this, like allowing the thread to be shared to stories so fluently is appealing I must say. Allow landscape mode for tablets and this thing is golden 👌🏼",positive
Hii threads I'm having an issue with posting a photo help out. I think that the wide frame photos are not fitting in it Plz reply,positive
Kicks me off everytime I post something. Considering how bad the Facebook feed has gotten over the last month it shouldn't be a surprise. At this point I'm wondering if they screwed Facebook up on purpose to send millions of set up Facebook users over to their other platform.,negative
"All pages expect the main timeline now leads to ""Something went wrong, please try again"".",negative
"The application keeps glitching since i open it, once i touch the screen it glitchs, can't use it at all",negative
This app is amazing after using it I thought of uninstalling twitter 😂...This is going to be even better than Twitter I have a feeling!! Thankyou Mark Zuckerberg Sir For this new Amazing Application - Threads !!,positive
Couldn't instal it on my desktop. Not an Instagram user so it was difficult to sign up taking an hour..,negative
"Ok, so again algorithm is going to feed you with all sorts of garbage. Make the ""see people you follow only"" mode.",negative
"Feed is flooded with random people I care nothing about, not seeing many posts from those I actually follow. Crashes anytime I try to post a photo",negative
Less informative and less engaging Twitter alternative. It's like Twitter except less of everything!,negative
"Calm and somewhat colected, it is missing some key features like hashtags and polls...but its still new so we can let it off on that...thinking they will come in a couple weeks",positive
It is a good app although I'd like it to have dark mode enabled because I like my settings in light mode and social media on dark mode,positive
Yes i think it is better than Twitter it is fact it si a great deal better than TWITTER but there is one disadvantage you cant enter TREAD without Instagram account but i liked Thread,positive
"upload a photo then crash, close app immediately, fix it soon, what app is that if like that, cannot upload a photo",negative
I don't have Instagram account. Unable to login with others social networks like Facebook... Finally uninstalled the app.,negative
To login it demands instagram account. It is conditional. If you have not an Instagram account you can't login in threads .,negative
Good interface. Need to set it up to be able to translate threads.,positive
Threads is a spin-off app from Instagram that focuses on conversations rather than visual content. You can log in with your Instagram account and share text updates and join public discussions. And the same is an app that messes with Twitter. Its owner is Mark Zuckerberg. ...THANK YOU...,positive
Not supporting on my mi readme note 5 pro lots of bug i can see....and content is overlays on each other beside open on another screen !!,negative
Didn't feel the need of the blue colored version of this same app but other than that everything looks great,positive
"I felt this app is yet another time waste, with no particular use case other than bringing down Twitter and does it provide a healthy competition to improve Twitter....hell nooo",negative
"It's Just a another social media like Twitter, And some of the bugs were there and it still need some more features more than Twitter",negative
I will give the app 5 stars because the feels like Instagram but in a smoother way The interface looks very nice and cool,positive
I hope the thread can be automatically translated. I found it slightly difficult that i need to translate the thread using different app,positive
"A little nitpick but my phone settings literally does not have a dark mode option. Please put it in the app, thanks.",positive
There is a glitch can't see full screen there isn't option to send screenshot so i would have sent it to show you guys.,negative
Lol doesnt even work. If your insta is linked you cant unfollow people on thread or you unfollow them on Instagram its kind dumb. Post wont send fail message everytime. So far not impressed.,negative
"It's only Instagram but with less features. A downgrade, so to speak.",negative
"Shows Threads from people & companies I don't follow and have no interest in. Despite changing settings, app doesn't just show me accounts I follow and want to see.",negative
It's a bit disapppointing when you tried to log in and it will ask you for your Instagram username and password. Where in when you log in with Instagram you used you Facebook credentials for it. Kinda confusing 😕,negative
"This is such a pleasent surprise, couldn't have asked for more at this juncture, was worried and tired of juncks, and not having access to my thread. Meta is always my happy place for combination of reasons and I completely trust it's business ethics more than any provider's from the start until now, looking forward to connect threads.",positive
Worst app Twitter is better than threads and Twitter is better optimized its run smoothly on my device and on the other hand threads is lagging littlebit in my device copy paste is not the best solution and if you try to uninstall it your Instagram account gonna deactivate i cant even DM my crush,negative
I cancelled all pending requests and it's still sending requests fix this!!! Can I have a prize for telling this bug?,negative
I am one of first 100 peoples (77th actually) worldwide giving review to this app within 3 hrs of its launch. Really looking forward having a good time with this social media space.,positive
"Total bs app. No concern for privacy ,just another attempt by meta to get our data. Would prefer Twitter anyday over it, it's just a leftist attempt to destroy twitter",negative
App crashes after opening with blurry text and not smooth functioning.,negative
"Needs Instagram acc to use. Instagram requires a real identity. I just want to read posts, not put my real identity out there for the world to use",negative
"There is NO REASON this app needs my financial info, my search history, browsing history or sensitive info. Just another way for Mark Zuckerberg to get rich from violating every users privacy.",negative
"After connect to instagram, it take too much time, app will stuck I'm trying to open app 3 to 4 times but app can't open",negative
This app is so much better than the bird app. The feed pretty much shows everyone's posts. And this app is pretty fun.,positive
"Personally, I prefer Twitter more than threads. It is exactly like replacing Google with Bard, but now there is not even a name of Bard.",negative
The only way to erase the data they've collected or delete the threads profile is by deleting your instagram account. I wish I had known this sooner.,negative
"Great app! I've found many interesting people here. 👍 Please, add auto-translation. 😊",positive
I like the simplistic layout. Haptic feedback is nice too. Still too early to say,positive
"Thread's🧵 user interface is really great. i like it very much, Thanks to Mark Zuckerberg and Meta. ❤",positive
"wow! this is such an original, innovative, and creative idea, just like the stories on Instagram. I am so proud of the Instagram team for coming up with such a great idea. 5 stars 👍👍",positive
"Crashing constantly everytime I tried to upload a picture. 1 star for now, will update once it's solved",negative
I love the app and i think if you can add a translation section same as Instagram that will be greatly appreciated,positive
I don't like the fact that your phone has to be on dark mode to active the app's dark mode.,negative
"As there is no translation option, trying to copy the text will result with the app crashing.",negative
"I don't know what's wrong with my thread but it keep glitching. Since the first day I've downloaded this app, I can't even use it.",negative
"Loving it so far, looking forward to more features being added over time!",positive
All usernames are fetching from Instagram. It's not possible to claim your username. I could not create a profile. Rubbish.,negative
"Garbage, so here we go... an app about threads, well at least on Twitter you can look at threads without the app crashing.",negative
What a waste it is. This app is is a complete copy of twitter and also a waste of storage for our android and complete waste of time for ourselves. 😤,negative
The text and contents overlap and all letters overlap making it a mess and impossible to use.,negative
Great App. Kudos Mark. I hope the experience gets even better in the coming days as more people sign up.,positive
The app is amazing and has simple features unlike Twitter where newbies finds it difficult to use. Congratulations to the Meta team for this fantastic and extraordinary 'INSTA TWITTER'!!,negative
The experience is very poor. The display after opening threads is not visible and clear.,negative
"Super app threads, So nice,easily used and covered all india levels..🙃🙃🙃🙃 30 minutes 1millan above view and install it.",positive
Why i can't post picture here while everyone can. It stop suddenly right after i click the attachment feature.,positive
It very good apps but even better if have translate to other language... For example Thai to English language....,positive
"Needing an Instagram account to sign up is horrible, I won't use the app until I can make a unique Threads account.",negative
I see posts from people I don't follow in my home timeline with no option to disable that. The promised ActivityPub support is still not available.,negative
"I don't have Instagram and I'm not interested on have one, but the app doesn't work if you don't have an Instagram account... 👎🏼",negative
"Excellent 👌 app ever but can't able to chat with friends, if possible setup it soon.",positive
"This app is not working properly, suddenly all the content and icon started overlapping with each other please fix this",negative
Home screen of app is showing overlapping issues. I'm unable to use it. So bad 😞,negative
There should not be an option to attach media. Soon there will be a no difference in threads & instagram.,negative
Great app but the rate at which I get restricted every time I follow people is annoying. Can't use the app comfortably,negative
Why after posting a video on this app does the sound disappear? Don't have this issue on TWITTER......,negative
"I don't know why , Everytime I open this apps it would shake like a broken screen but my screen is not broken though.😷",negative
Its better if you provide save option for photos and videos.,positive
"Great social network. I'm missing a few twitter features, but hopefully they will come in the future. For now, it's just great.",positive
I cant log in both instagram and thread since there was this issue called unmapped ig error. Can you please look into the issue,negative
"This app is perfect Especially for young adolescents and teens, one thing I would love to have someday is the dark theme",positive
I don't understand why my app keeps on freezing and I can't do anything on it. Does it have device compatability?,negative
Stiff 1:1 scrolling makes this essentially unusable as a modern social media app. Just use regular Android scrolling.,negative
Too much personal data harvesting. MUCH MORE than chinese tik-tok... Un-installed without using..,negative
The app was working pretty fine at first but now I am experiencing glitch and unable to do any action.,negative
It needs to not be so much like Twitter. Maybe not have everyone in the whole world showing up on everyone's threads. It would be great if I could just have the people/groups I actually follow to show up on my thread. ???,positive
"A wonderful alternative to other search engines; much better in the realm of privacy and personalisation. Fully recommend to anyone looking for a more secure, honest, simple, user-friendly, and private browser - as well as anyone in general. The wide assortment of ad-blockers and add-ons are wonderful. Ever since switching I will never go back, and I'm very glad that I did. Google Chrome is awful in comparison. Seriously considered",positive
This apps feela like broken phone you cannot see clearly because all the post the artist is like shaking .,negative
App closes whenever I try to post anything. I resort to typing what I want to say externally then pasting it after.,negative
The application don't work properly... The interface is weird the letters are overlapping each other,negative
Simple & Sleek. Lacks some basic features like hashtag & trend which should be added in new updates.,positive
"it's ugly if we see about home page , it's simillar of twitter and it's like just new virsion of it . Try to change the way to use it , it's gonna be more better and it cames with people when you do .",negative
Much better than anything else out there but needs hashtags and the ability to tailor your feed.,positive
"My only experience is when scroll into the feed, it goes crazy. Like really crazy",negative
Random feed sucks. It makes the experience awful and the social app loses its purpose. Terrible experience.,negative
"The problem is, there's no translation option, I just wish we can translate other language to english :)",positive
There is an app crash that I can't do anything at the app and I hope that crash will be fixed soon .,negative
"No real options to sign up. It wants for me to log in with Instagram, but it has been years since I ha e used Instagram",positive
I have a bug where i cant use the app beacuse the text is doubled and when i try to scroll it keeps multiplying and i cant read anything and cant use the app,negative
"It is glitchy as soon as i scroll my screen, the text leaves it's shadows and merges with the current screen",negative
"There is some problem in this app, my follower followed me, we accepted 5 and thought I would do it after a while and went to my hat after a while.",negative
"Everything is fine, but make some changes like add bold letters for usernames and add double tap to zoom",positive
"After registering, everything are glitchy except the navbar. I cant even use the app, pls fix this! My phone is xperia xz1",negative
"What to say, its an amazing app with lots of features. It has good UI as well.",positive
"No tags, no trending just a good copy of twitter with low features and full of insta vibes... Please make the interface looks like real",negative
Worst experience as it is not opening even atleast for 2 times i have uninstalled it still not working and now i have uninstalled it,negative
Main feed is 10% stuff I want to see 90% is random trash from accounts I don't even follow. If I wanted that I'd be on tiktok.,negative
This is worthless to install app everything is same like insta with some little add one and if you want to delete your thread account u need to delete your instagram too that means these capatalist are forcing u to not uninstall ur account and I can see some privacy data leakage in this app worst app just a big giant company trying to supress the peoples with its capitalist powers,negative
"When I joined threads there were only 12 persons already downloaded I was on 13th to download it this is good app right now but there must should be option for translation any vintect wriiten on the post .There should be same features like Instagram ""Insights"" etc.",negative
"this app is fantastic but the only problem is that, it is slow when posting videos.",positive
i like the app it is really easy to use and is really fitting easy minds and complicated but the reason i am giving 4 star because it is a copy version of Twitter,positive
"Genuinely horrid experience. Download if you want to be advertised to by a bunch of unfunny people with checkmarks, I guess.",negative
An app for this is idiotic. There is nothing this app can do that a web page can't. I don't put garbage apps on my phone and this is firmly in that category.,negative
"So far so good, it barely came out and I already like it better then Twitter/TikTok, etc. It has that old Twitter nostalgia that I craved.",positive
Tried to create an account and it was instantly suspended despite filling in all information correctly.,negative
Threads doesn't work properly on Vivo device screen is spread and got stuck please fix this issue...and plzz make it Android 9 version,negative
"It's so fun to use. I have an amazing experience, reading, talking and listening, I love threads",positive
App is good but some freatures need to improve. For example : threads cannot be edited.,positive
I'm going to love this app! At least a stable platform to replace a chaotic experience,positive
"Chaos on screen .. messages are overlapping to each other, unreadable.. bad bad apps.. still a billion mile away from twitter..",negative
"App is currently pretty bare bones and requires some user setup, but finally a viable twitter alternative.",positive
It has been weeks and the app still glitches upon opening till the point that nothing is readable.,negative
"Its really cool specially in the first version, it also be cool that when we scroll up, see the app icon to tap it and get a better reflesh action",positive
Omg this social media is so amazing and fast. I love this app because i can see information and news Media faster than other,positive
"i love it sm, please make this app a safe place. Also,please include making following 'private' and feeds for 'following' only and not from strangers.",negative
Its really a nice app for communicating with family and friends and it's very much similar to Twitter.,positive
"Make search page as trending page, include option to show posts only from the accounts i follow (no suggestions), Include bookmark threads feature with folder option.",positive
"Not bad. If Twitter is to go out in a blaze of idiocy we could do a lot worse than this to replace it. Could do with a few tweaks here and there (mainly not directly connecting to Instagram for example), but it's still young so I can give it a bit of slack for now.",positive
Full on glitches. Not working at all.. Now Its clear why it got only 3.8⭐ stars in less than 24hours of launching.,negative
It's great and all. I just wish i could upload audios or record a voice note and post,positive
Please bring the sound in videos which I have uploaded in this app. Voice is not working. please like and follow me. Increase my followers and make my all videos viral,positive
Not working on Redmi Note 6 pro. Can't go from one page to another page. Scrolling is not working properly,negative
"Looks like Instagram with a different name. If you have insta, you don't need this at all.",negative
My app keeps stopping anytime I'm trying to post a picture and I wonder if I can't post other pictures that I have already posted on Instagram b,negative
Please make dark theme. Also if i open any profile then their follow request notification get hidden until i refresh the page.,positive
When I try to attach a picture with my threads the app suddenly closes... Can you plz fix this ....,positive
"I heard it has an easy ""sign in with Instagram"" function to sign up. But that was the ONLY way to sign up.",negative
"Thread is an amazing App, I just want to see more people using it, because it's the modern day twitter unlike twitter.",positive
"Amazing app you guys. This came at the right time, honestly. Cause now I can enjoy the thread experience without being worried of my view count",positive
"ehhh could be something but keep getting the error ""your thread failed to upload"" when posting a photo.",negative
"I just downloaded the thread app , and I fasing a lot of issue . I can't see creator's post properly.",negative
News feed is flickering non stop. Can't scroll anything. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.,positive
Amazing app better than Twitter. I'm using Twitter for 10 years but not active on it but in thread I used just 1 hour and become addicted. So cool 😎,positive
"I just installed and then uninstalled, totally wasted, if you don't have any Instagram account, you can't to login in threads, and we all know that Instagram is a su*ks.",negative
"""The app is nice, but it still needs improvement, like being able to mention a specific person.""",positive
Very satisfied with this program. Add an edit post option and daily story .,positive
"It's a great alternative to Twitter. I haven't using Twitter so much, I used it very rare. But I think I will use threads a lot. 😁",positive
"They loot your photos, videos, browser history, etc... Totally unsafe. Uninstaling threads app",negative
Looks much more optimized and easier to use. But we hope that Zuckerberg will not steal our data this time alsoj,positive
"Wish there was a dm section though. ANNND, save option for pictures (kudos to the high resolution)",positive
"Such a cozy platform visually, in my opinion. Just cannot scroll through my notifications.... can yall fix it that?",positive
Only for Instagram users. I don't have an Instagram account. So I can't use this app as it is asking for Instagram login credentials. Disappointed.,negative
"Anonymity is a right. My secondary account got banned practically as soon as I created it because I used my username as my ""real name"", even after verifying myself with a live image. Also, no way to search hashtags or cashtags from what I can tell.",negative
"I love the app so far, my only issue is trying to use it on my iPad, gives log in error message",positive
there's bug. there are lines on the screen and they pile up. please fix it.,negative
"This is scary similar to the Twitter app, except many posts appear to be taken down that shouldn't be. NOT the app for free speech. They are definitely losing their intellectual property rights infringement case.",negative
App not loading content. When I attempted to post a post on Threads it posted it to Instagram instead? Whaaaat?,negative
SOOO MUCH BETTER THAN TWITTER. Thanks for making this app. I already transfered all my Twitter contacts over and everything is working smoothly!,positive
So far I like it! Wish I could search key words. Reminds me a bit of tumblr and tumblr has been my home for years,positive
App is crushing while posting a thread with photo. Besides it uses more phone ram & lag the whole device.,negative
I actually waiting this app and finally wait is over and this is a amazing app . Thanks a @meta team to launching this app . Thanks again ☺️and congratulations meta team the app cross the 10M user's 🎉,positive
"This app is an amazing app, very interesting, but it doesn't have a future of direct message.",positive
"Full of glitches While scrolling full of Shaking screen,draging🥴 Fix it up , I already install the app👍 because of that glitches 😕 it is so irritating",negative
This app doesn't work properly... totally screen are blink doesn't shows the post and activity...,negative
"Really cool app giving chance for people to grow and connect easily, all we need now is a new update with loads of corrections",positive
Please fix the app every time I try to post a image it crashes IT'S STUPIDDDDDD but it's not bad I guess,negative
"I don’t like the two-in-one app idea. I have to be able to edit, delete threads acount while keeping isntagram's as it is",negative
This app is really cool in my opinion but please add a switch account button because I have to log out to switch account 🤧,positive
When is open it all the words including pictures and everything just comes under the like it just gets copied one another 😭,negative
I had issues with downloading this app..but came to figure out that some Antivirus apps don't allow it's installation.,positive
Not very well application but good for time wasting. Not only this application all applications such as Instragram Twitter and all meta app are time wasting.,positive
"The app idea is awesome, but there are so much filkering and overlaps while scrolling, the device is Xiaomi Redmi s2 3g ram",positive
1 star because my feed is full of suggested rubbish that I don't want to see just like Facebook and Instagram. I should only see posts from people I follow. Im sick of meta throwing complete nonsense on to our newsfeeds,negative
"since the moment i downloaded this app, my instagram keeps crashing. it's not even letting me open the app.",negative
"Dude this app is glitching so hard, I wish I could show you the ss, not able to use it even for a sec.",negative
"Great start, missing a couple features but it's a great base to build off of",positive
I have been face some problem. When I will be a post every times it's will be failed. So you should solve this problem as soon as possible.,negative
there is a bug at the application when i open it and login at my acc. and opened home the application melting over itself,negative
"I would love to be able to post to Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, all at once.",positive
"I have rated one star cuz actually I haven't used it yet , everytime i open the app it lags and it's terrible I can't use it cuz all things are in each others I can't describe anymore about my problem",negative
This app doesn’t work perfectly in Android 9 (Redmi 6A). Screen freezes when scrolling.,negative
Great app but add an option to create account without Instagram. I like threads but I hate using Instagram.,negative
Somehow UI is completely distorted for me. Everything is overlapping over each other.,negative
"This App have many bugs, first of all it is not load properly on Android and don't show post clearly.",negative
Switching between thread account unlike Instagram or Facebook is not flexible. We need to logout and switch,negative
App keep crashing whenever I should upload a photo !!! Not a good start for thread !!,negative
"The application is nice, but it needs some modifications, such as translating the posts",positive
"As of now, there is nothing wrong with it, and it will surely give good feedback when it says that it belongs to Instagram....",positive
this app litterary cracks and shakes like my screen has got issues but it doesn't if it did i would not be commenting on this app peacefully pls can this issue be fixed,negative
"What is this! I can't handle this app in my phone. When I open it ,it's like display broken screen",negative
"My threads app has been glitching continuous, I even reinstalled it once but still nothing has changed.",negative
"At first glance, UI is pretty dope (mid between twitter & Instagram). Kinda like it.",positive
AN APP WITH VERY BASIC AND GROSS FEATURES. WILL TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO TAKE TWITTER'S POSITION. THREADS IS NOT THAT SERIOUS AS TWITTER. IF YOU DON'T NEED THIS...DON'T USE IT.,negative
"It's a good App, it has features of Instagram and Twitter all mixed up in one place.",negative
If you want to be better and compete with Twitter you have to have Trending Topics. Newsworthy stories not just celebrities posting. That's what made Twitter famous because people came there to see what was going on in the world.,negative
Signed up for threads go instantly suspended now I've got to upload a selfie with a code when I have done nothing wrong just wanted to use the app.,negative
"Poorly designed app, at least expecting if cloned but still expecting some ui and functional changes and new approaches rather than just copy paste",negative
"Screen scrolling speed very slow. To compare other app, Screen refresh rate very low in this app",negative
Feed is quite unorganized. Slow refresh. Congested interface.,negative
"Least app just like Instagram it only increase your dopamine there is no info no intresting debates, all come like today I tried this food and it's awesome, all boomer talks 😁 waste of time",negative
I rate 2 stars because I can't change my profile picture in it and it's bugging me out please fix this issue.,negative
broken... I know it's a new app but on android version of the app even the slightest scroll down I get the ghost screen error ☹️,negative
Unable to upload or post a photos... Pls fix the Bug.. (upload time automatically app closed).,negative
"Keep crashing while im still writing a content. Fix it with haste, or ill give a permanent 1 start",negative
"Your this app is also perfect as hell but like Insta, she will never accepts my request🙂 zuck if you are reading this please tell her I also do Exist. Thank you!",positive
"Lots of bugs, i still cannot add a photo to my thread, the app keep closing on its own",negative
"It's just a knock-off of Twitter filled with liberals and celebrities who didn't like Elon removing a lot of censorship. So if you don't like free speech, can't handle someone else's opinion or just make everything about yourself, you'll love this app. For myself, though, I like hearing opinions, having debates, and not seeing a one-sided narrative of society. This app is a joke, it freezes half the time too. Just stick with Twitter, this app sucks just like Facebook...",negative
"@instagram the threads app i installed but its not work correctly (after open the app posts ,followers ,account details are mixed in one tab)",negative
"I wish you would add the clubhouse feature so we could talk together again, it would be really great",positive
"Horrible it's a piece of garbage. I think Meta tried to punch Twitter 🤦🏻‍♂️. Five minutes later I hated the app, and I'm currently thinking of deleting my Instagram account.",negative
Very generic. You also can't delete without deleting your Instagram account. Privacy concerns.,negative
Scrolling isn't smooth as instagram but the App is great the features are okay.But they should improve on some things,negative
"If you used before Twitter, u definitely gotta use this. U gotta have a instagram acc to use this though. This app have NO ADS (NO ADS AT ALL). I hace a question here though, do we have dark theme?",positive
"Seems Cool, but it creates a lot of typo error and you can't edit your thread after posting.",positive
The app threat people like a product and not a person. Taking your every detail including your personal health information... No wonder it can't show it's face in the EU. 🤦🏾,negative
So far so good the app has been fun and great but now it keeps on crashing and my phone reports it has a bug,negative
"A general flexible and nice app, missing some features but if it's one thing I know about mark Zuckerberg he always brings the updates",positive
It's animations are Good plus some other features but otherwise completely copy of twitter completely not recommend,negative
It's Awesome but there is no massage option. Twitter is better than threads. I think the massage option must need in threads.,positive
"Ui are good and intuitive, anyway the community not large enough and cannot search or see the trend of the hashtags.",positive
"The app isn't working properly, while trying to use this, I can't even read a single text. It's so annoying.",negative
"Hi ! this rate is the first, literally! I give it one cuz it forced me to log in by Instagram and I didn't have one !",negative
Love the ease of use so far but can't seem to post a photo (even after resizing),positive
Hi. Experiencing several crashes in my handset (Vivo Z1 Pro). Please fix the crashes.,negative
"This is just a terrible clone of Twitter... Blue check the lot, a bug ridden mess. Uninstalled.",negative
The app is smooth but it is crashing when I try to pull up a previous reply.,positive
What a great app. I have been using for 3 years until. Hope to see amazing slots game and gambling Ads 😘,positive
"Extremely basic, lacks the most simple (and often most important) features an app of this category should have. Half the app is mangled together with IG, you can't really personalize your profile, it's slow, has the same policies as IG, isn't privacy friendly, doesn't have a chronological feed and some of the very few options it does have simply don't work. The only pros I could find is that it looks pretty and is relatively organized, but it doesn't come close to the competitor. 3/10",negative
"Finally, An app that can truly Rival Twitter, still needs more fine-tuning but this app clearly has so much potential",positive
"The no ads UI is good, for now. Picture quality is good, too",positive
Thread is good app. Interesting and userfriendly interfaces. That's why i give 5 star.,positive
It's a good app and growth quickly 💕💕 but it's bad features are blue tik of every celebrate not get common people 😔,positive
"Looks like you have to have an Instagram account, I don't have one and don't want one, so Threads is getting uninstall.",negative
The whole thing is broken or bugged. Texts are overlapping... Please fix it.,negative
Better than Twitter. easy to use . got connected to old knows easily. just waiting some exciting updates 😊,positive
"For me now this app before I updated it is working very well, since I update it not allowed me to Post either picture or note don't know what happened",negative
"Want too much personal data, just a knock off lesser version of Twitter. Another personal data farm of the FB branch.",negative
"I think mine have bugs, cause it keeps lagging, even i multiple times i re download it still keeps getting lag",negative
"Downloaded to try it and see if I wanted it. Hadn't realised I needed an Instagram account, which I don't have. I don't feel like selling soul to Zuckerberg today so I'm deleting.",negative
it doesn't work properly everytime i scroll the text will be doubled and overlap to eachother,negative
"I already have twitter. I don't need another app to eat my RAM, drain the juice and yes we all know how META handles our senstive data 🤣.",negative
"I love it. I hope to see an audio chat room. That is what most of us really want, especially us from Twitter",positive
Can't remove the bottom 3 phone buttons and that's where the app puts all the confirmation buttons so the app is unusable,negative
New bug : when i am trying to see my coment replay / automaticly back and closing the app. Please fix this🥺,positive
Translation option is needed. Feed for only following is needed. Auto-play check is needed.,positive
Pretty good so far! I wish there were ways to see what's popular or trending....hopefully it gets added in the future!,positive
"This is a very good social media platform, it is much better than twitter, I hope that the application will continue to work well.",positive
Keyboard covers letters on screen when typing. And add edit to typing options for one to easily alter writings with ease.,positive
Update.. Still sucks after updates today July 19th. Just put it in chronological order like Twitter does and everything will be perfect I don't want to see threats from people I don't follow Seems nice but what the hell all I see is people that I don't follow I go check off thread only people I follow and yet I still see Toys R Us in my timeline like why I just want to see who I follow in chronological order of the time they send a message have the people who created this and never use Twitter?,negative
"Not joining this garbage. 1 because you cannot make Instagram function properly starting at basic commenting on posts! 2, this is a money grab. F you tech billionaires. You don't need more money!",negative
"So far, the app is amazing. I love it for its simplicity and minimalist vibe. That being said, I have a few suggestions regarding the 'following' feature. It's quite hard to check the followers one by one to check whether I followed them already or not. So, aside from the ""'remove"" option, perhaps you can add a feature where we can easily check if we are mutuals with that user.",positive
Very disappointed of this app. It's not that much worth that my phone has it. I would like to say don't download this. Poor quality. Poor management.,negative
"This App Is very smooth and user friendly to use. Its just like Twitter 2.0 , i hope we can see some new features in this app in future, altho awesome app.",positive
"Stupid and big privacy issues! You give away more info than other platforms and can't delete your account! Massive fail Zuck, you absolute p.o.s.",negative
Want to attach screenshots of the problem I am facing. Screen got shivering while I am entering into it and it is the worst😠,negative
Uninstalling. This app collects so much data that it might as well be spyware.,negative
"Threads is currently glitchy on my side, with the text distorting and covering my whole screen.",negative
Just make it where you can rotate for landscape photos and videos and we're good,positive
"First of all ,this app simply easy to use, by all means can u guys make an update about adding some translation words ,thanks...",positive
I give 5 star but the developer should make something important which is the ability to download image videos etc,positive
"You have to have an Instagram account, which will scour your phone and take all your personal information. No thanks, so I guess I'm sticking with Twitter",negative
It shows a lot of ads and promoted accounts! Even more than Instagram does.,negative
Keep it simple and don't add cringe features like you did with Instagram.,positive
"If only i can register in this app instread of donwloading instagram to register as well... Kinda foolish, because not everyone is an instagram user and i do not intend to use instagram.",negative
I love it so much to be honest but i think it would fun if it has like private chats like Instagram but overall it's amazing,positive
"This app is like a baby of Instagram, haha jk, it's good but still needs some improvements but great.<3",positive
"Good app, needs a way to save the photos and videos. And a react button like Facebook has",positive
I my Android mobile this app is not working properly the screen is overlapping. So I am requesting Instagram Team to fix it pls,negative
My favourite “Threads” tip so far: Easily reshare any message to your IG story by tapping the paper airplane (share) icon and then selecting “Add to Story”,positive
Not yet a good App. Needs improvement. It crashed and it glitches.,negative
"I can't even see anything when I open the app, a lot of bugs andnothing appears correctly",negative
When I open the app the app loads over the existing post screen and it hangs and unable to use at all,negative
So... how about a feature to save media.. like.. save photos or something.,positive
"Nope, still connected to instagram and all Meta's data , can't be trusted .",negative
Yeah this is way more nicer and easier to use than Twitter just add DMS camera maybe even like reels or something like that and this app doesn't have any gliches,positive
"i can't open the app, when i opened it the app was suddenly stopped working or log out automatically.",negative
Has nothing to offer that Twitter doesn't other than very strict guidelines on what you can say. The only reason this app even exists is to data harvest.,negative
"Good, but we should get an option to turn off recommended threads cause we don't care about a lot of these content creators.",negative
Awesome application there are some bugs that need to fix but it's a great start,positive
Show me the updates from the people that I FOLLOW. Why pushing random accounts to the feed? I haven't come across a single friend's account in the last two days.,negative
"Interface visual bugs at all. I can't see anything, just pics",negative
"In my opinion, this is the better app from Twitter. It gives us a better user experience and reliability. It is more similar like a Twitter.",positive
It doesn't display properly like the wordings are overlapping each other. Pls solve it thanks,negative
"Not helping at all, i just started a journey to get my audience and it doing nothing, wat de hecc, why zucc's social media (beside facebook and whatsapp) are useless.",negative
Off to a great start! I finally have something else to play other than that far right conspiracy theorists Angry Bird app.,positive
Buggy. Keeps crashing on Pixel 6. I had to uninstall and download again twice now.,negative
When i open the app the gets glitch... When i scroll down or up it gets overlap one after another plz resolve...,negative
This app just gave me a heart attack because now I came to now about it that if I delete this app my instagram account will also get deleted. Just bring a new update to unlink my account. Or bring any solution for deleting it.,negative
"Very easy to use and not so crowded like instagram, more to read than see.",positive
Screen getting stuck and texts are overlapping whenever opening the app.,negative
The amount of personal data collected is unbelievable. Very unsafe and dangerous.,negative
"Waiting for new features to come, but looks like a really good Twitter alternative!",positive
It's a cool platforms just as addictive as Instagram....just needs a few fixes but i like it,positive
They really need to fix the glitches and bugs on Instagram first before launching clone apps.,negative
"So far a much better replacement for Twitter. Not perfect, but has infinitely more promise than Twitter.",positive
Such a waste app full of glitches. Scrolling isn't working at all. Please look into it,negative
"After using my account for a few days my account was blocked. I haven't even made a post, they just decided I wasn't me. I'm signed in through my Facebook account, which isn't locked.",negative
Bad experience not working properly you have to work on interface really disappointed.,negative
The agree button on the terms page when signing up doesn't do anything and you can't get past it,negative
"Has potential, but I hope they add in a search tab so you can search hashtags instead of home feed only.",positive
"This app has a big problem like Instagram, automatic download of videos, why should I download videos that I never want to see?!",negative
"App is Good But Thread App need More improvement like Missing ""Thred Inbox"" or save photos or videos or varification request please fix all problems of this app !",positive
Malfunction: showing multiple texts! Making it unable to read a thing.,negative
"A very nice experience with the app, one week into the app and I'd say it's better off Twitter..... looking forward to the new update....",negative
App is pretty smooth and clean on the first day itself. Very impressed,positive
I want to use this app but why the hell I need an Instagram accout to do so. Means I am forced to create an Instagram account or this platform is solely for meta existing user not for new ones.,negative
"my first time using app but this app is totally glitching screen but everything like scrolling yes it can but the screen app is glitch, just fix the app :(",negative
Good app so far I wish there was an option to translate and also the ability to dm .,positive
"I have been using this aap from this morning and this is actually very neat and clean, really simple and user friendly. Hope it stays like this. I prefer Threads over Twitter. 5 stars.",positive
Not a stand alone apps requiring an Instagram account... Not Interested if there are strings attached 🧵,negative
The app doesn't open from the external links. Links only open in the web browser.,positive
It is lagging and glitching too much ... I am not able to use it.. So frustrating,negative
Best app. But give some good features like chat and trending page. Good luck to developer.,positive
"Everything works, but I need a chronological timeline that only shows me threads from people I follow.",positive
"Cleaner content than Twitter, so far, but you can't search topics amongst public posts/threads? Yikes.",negative
This app isn't working properly...🤮 I can't upload my profile picture and I can't share threads on my Instagram story,negative
"As an advocate of free expression and an ardent believer in the power of open dialogue, I found the experience of using the speech-controlled social media app nothing short of a regressive nightmare. Instead of fostering an environment that encourages diversity of thought and robust discussions, this app imposes a heavy-handed system that curtails individual liberties and stifles meaningful interactions.",negative
"There is a bug on my apps everytime i try to scroll my threads Everything become fizzy and can't read anything Please fix it, my device is redmi note 6 pro",negative
Needs more edit settings and cleaner ui along with easier posting all and all i like the algorithm keep it like that,positive
Because it is a thread app why do you limit the number of post a person can like. Like now Its like try again later. Limited actions let it remain on Instagram,negative
"Good app, missing some basic features which they say are in dev also get a few force closes/crashes occasionally",positive
It is very useful to use compared with Twitter..but it's has a minor problem like put translation for all threads for users.,positive
"Constantly crashing trying to upload a photo, otherwise a good place with positive energy",positive
Encountered blurry display when scrolling looks the layer of the text and background overlapping,negative
"Content feed is full of people I neither know, nor have ever heard of. Scrolling forever to see anyone I follow. Just going to keep using Mastodon.",negative
"Hello threads, this app is clean and clear, feel great to read on it, oh it reminds me of those old good days of tweeter just to tweet our openion",positive
"Need Twitter Alternative. With the takeover of Elon Musk on Twitter, the platform was becoming quite unstable. Now, with tough alternatives in the marketplace, there's going to be some stability.",positive
"You can't create a new account. You have to use an already existing instagram account. Also, there is no website on PC. Useless.",negative
Not the best..... its same as twitter layout but worse. Not for me. I've got too many socials already. And only use 3 don't want to add more,negative
Not bad I guess there's not much to show it's just post from random people no way of messaging I guess need more updates Instagram is better than Threads as for twitter vs Threads - twitter win if Instagram and twitter they're good you can't not win the twitter using threads it's better to use Instagram instead Facebook is better than threads!,negative
"An application bug appeared, everything turned off and nothing works, reinstallation did not help",negative
It's glitching so much that I can't even scroll through the page (or any page literally!),negative
"The app ia good and fun but i have a problem using the app ,, the written laters reflect with each other and doaent looks so good 😏😏",negative
There is some bug I think whenever I'm going to upload something.the app automatically closed🤷🏻‍♂️ fix this.,negative

"Yall experiencing pages and posts overlapping each other... Go to profile, theres button at the top right corner then report a problem.. just go there then go back to homepage and the bug's gone☺️",positive
"It's glitching like hell, I can't even TRY the app, cause as soon as I open it it's just A COMPLETE GLITCH",negative
"The experience is too short to share. It's been only two days of it's launch. Until now, loving it.",positive
Application is really good but we can't able to logged in more accounts at a one time like instagram.,positive
"You are just signing IN to an Instagram account. You cannot sign UP for a NEW Thread account, so all they are doing is transfering Instagram members into Thread members. Seems like a good way to limit conversations to only those they already know. Sort of like the Democrats calling themselves something else to register more votes. Sneaky ploy.",negative
Good app but looks like its still in beta mode with lots of functions still needs to be implemented,positive
i like it I think it will be very good if it adds the ability to categorize the threads.,positive
If you want to be censored and you want to be shafted for one side of the conversation. This is the app that you need to use. Nobody wanted anything made by Facebook. Facebook is a terrible app and this is second half to it.,negative
"There is no dark mode,When I logged in it was light mode only by default, but in my friends phone it was dark mode by default",negative
"There's a big glitch in the whole app, I can't describe it through words but you have to watch it",negative
I guess its the first review from india. This app was released just a few days ago and its so smooth like it was there all the time.,positive
My tread having bug/glitch this is why my thread don't work anyway so please check it out and repair it! My Instagram I'd :- abuu.talibb,negative
It actually have a lot of bugs! Thread team should fix the bug first before it launched!,negative
"Real close, very good, lots of hope. Just keep it simple and you win easily.",positive
"It is a good alternative to Twitter, one advantage is that it prohibits explicit content.",positive
"no ways to discover new accounts, no hashtags, no in-app messages, app has potential but falls flat",negative
"In my redmi note 6pro Threads app will crashes continuously and didn't works well,it should be a negative for me as a user of meta ,VERY VERY BAD META TEAM, so meta team please make the issue correct by giving a stable update of THREADS",negative
I liked it very much infact it is an awsome start of all new platform particularly when most of the netizens were feeling bored 😀 Good Luck to Threads ✌️,positive
Nice app which will help us to be connected with the latest news and updates and with our loved ones.,positive
"please, PLEASE let me see ONLY accounts that I FOLLOW. I keep seeing people and stuff i don't care about on top, and have to scroll pretty far down just to see people i actually follow... and that's just super annoying.",negative
cant post gifs they come out purple and green and distorted and am not the only one that is happening to fix the app,negative
"The home screen got a big glitch, the words are spreading around . Please fix it",negative
It didn't work properly. Some glitche is happend during usage. Worst experience,negative
This app needs a lot of work i cant refresh in general it looks fine cant complain but keeps shutting down,positive
"I can't log in as I am not receiving the login confirmation code. Might be that I am from Australia, not sure ☹️",negative
Good start but it does feel rushed with all of the missing features.,positive
UI crashes on every interaction. App totally unusable.,negative
Needs more features (especially followibg only page) and themes options bc it looks pretty boring but its p good so far,positive
"Retarded, you can't search for anything by keyword or #Tag. It shows only accounts!",negative
Super App which is connected to Instagram. Hopefully more updates will come there soon.,positive
Would be nice if they add a dark mode for AMOLED and OLED phones better for battery life I guess .,positive
Its great and positive so far but still there are some features missing..,positive
"Needs more bandwidth, it keeps crashing when I go to post something.",negative
"Not a mind to be found. Like Twitter, but for the dull-normal. If you like fake positivity, corniness and old memes, you've found your app.",negative
Nice & u can download it's it's just useful for getting updated and news of all around the globe,positive
It's a great app. I love it but to the developers I want say that Where is the dark theme? Thread is glitching in my phone dark mode😐😐,positive
"Please add a media feed like instagram, so it will be easy to see media and please make the picture can be saved too",positive
So far so good I would like to put this out there please please make sure that this platform stays Scam free we don't need or want it. And please keep it free from hate only advertisement s from real business not scams,positive
This is awesome app but thread is connected with instagram. Mark Zuckerberg sir please make an app which integrates all meta platform app in one place.,positive
"Sometimes when a person followed me, the notification won't show up so I don't realize that",positive
"Initial impression was like walking into a town square, where there are thousands of people shouting random stuff that you don't care about, all hoping to attract the biggest crowd.",negative
Pretty good so far. Even though if I want to delete my account I have to delete my Instagram as well. Still better than Twitter under Twitters current circumstances.,positive
"First experience was the worst, installation took ages and after logging in, I cannot scroll down the activity page....",negative
Just add feature to download images & turn night mode on/off in the app itself.,positive
"I changed my insta password and now threads won't let me even open the app, let alone a login screen or anything",negative
There is no option to sign up without an Instagram account. DOUBLE WACK!,negative

All settings are good...but u need to clear bugs in threads...coz can't refresh my page .😕,positive
This app is crashing everytime when I open this app so I kindly requested to remove that crash,negative
Perfect. But could we please have downloading the photos and videos option?,positive
"Broken app, the screen glitches so bad. I can't use it at all.",negative
"Don't like social media, never had a Twitter account, but I like the idea of Twitter going bust due to all the bad choices by Elon Musk, so downloading this and signing up to help out boost it's numbers",positive
"Easy, simple ui and functions and very enjoyable, waiting for more features",positive
"I was facing some problem while using this app , Actually when i start using this app there was a glitch my screen get stuck",negative
"Competition breeds innovation, despite my distaste for meta at times what they're doing will surely shake up the industry.",positive
This is too disappointing that app does not working.. like every where is too much glich the font are displaying on another,negative
These app is incredible They is no other app like this in the social media marketing this is the best. THREADERS assemble Just yesterday I joined I have 100k+ follower I wish this app would make sure we can chat anyone privately please 🥺,positive
Why it's not opening for the access it's not running also if you want to delete this it not happening,negative
"overall is good, but please fix when i will post media, the apps goes to so laggy. So i hope it's get fix",positive

"Very nicely done, would like the option to use GIFs without having to upload them",positive
The app is good but we need the save pictures button and dms and I can't change mine to dark mode,positive
Amazing engineering for an app to open up with such an influx of users without major bugs or crashes.,positive
First time opening threads and it instantly crashed can't even do anything it crashes without any message pls fix this,negative
It’s need good amount of Update and also need to allow only following people post in feed and also need to add the HASHTAG It's THE MOST IMPORATANT THING :>,positive
Improvements needed not very catchy... Nothing close to twitter's interface.. it's just another app...,negative
What is this glitch? The texts in the app threads is converging...... Fix this glitch as soon as possible 😒😠,negative
"Signed up, seeing nothing but utter rubbish, people who like the sound of their own voices.",negative
There is a glitch in this app. Cant use it properly till now. Hope it will get fixed soon.,negative
It so amazing app more than what people can think or though about it its special app for each and everyone that life on the earth.,positive
"I know it can't be exactly like T!, but it just doesn't function properly. It's going to need some improvements. Until then I'm on that other app.",negative
"Very stable and almost no bugs, good job meta team, this will be big.",positive
Interface seems so crowded and messed up. Don't feel like using this at all,negative
Threads not working in my device . Maybe a glitch or something I don't know. I have sent an email please have a look,negative
It can beat twitter. Nice app but more features can be added and i guess they are coming sooner...,positive

"It looks fun, and was, until everything stopped loading and then the app made me unfollow about 40 people from my Instagram",negative
I'm not interested in opening an Instagram account just to try out Threads. So it's an immediate uninstall for me...,negative
"Fun and clean but needs some details like backgrounds, private messages and others.",positive
"It's literally Twitter, but from Meta. So you already know your data is not safe and there is no free speech.",negative
App crash when I want to select a two lines text in right to left language My phone's language in English ...,positive
As is it's impossible to use. I do not have an Instagram account. I cannot use the app without creating an Instagram account. You cannot create an Instagram account from within the app. Ergo the app is impossible to use without already having an Instagram account or going to Instagram to create an account outside of the app. 0/10,negative
Great so far but it needs a translation button. Am I missing where to translate a post?,positive
"Ugly UI and it feels so slow. Why does this company continue making bad apps/site? Nice job bootlicking verification, as if anybody with 1 braincell cares about that stuff",negative
"Absolutely pointless, doesn't show my follows, but instead spams me with random stuff.",negative
I really like it! Easy to use. Converts instagram following & followers instantly too.,positive

"Easy to use, very intuitive UI. Join the fun",positive
Best App Alternative to Twitter. Account Login is So Easy with Instagram account 😄. Keep Developing and Also please Don't allow poltics inside the app like Twitter,positive

App lags while uploading high quality pictures. Throw you out from the app.,negative

So far this app is sounding very promising. Let's see if the pace picks up in a few weeks!,positive
"It's working really well, please add themed icon support for Android.",positive
"It is essentially Twitter minus the Elon Musk stench. Pretty good. Needs a trending subpage though, would make it perfect.",positive
"The ui looks horrible, I feel like I'm in a IfunnyX comment section. Even the LegoLife app has a better layout!",negative
Love it! Everything works and the app seems like it's only going to get better. Good work everyone.,positive
"It bugs the first time that i used it is okay but after like 20 hours maybe because there's a lot of users are using at the past 24 hours, my followers on Instagram account is what I saw on my threads and all of my post Is gone hahaha like I only sleep for 4 hours then after that deleted all",negative
Have high hopes but not sure why I need an Instagram account. Else could use personal email or something.,negative
"I Could Love This App, If It Would Stop Showing My An Bunch Of People I Don't Follow More Than The People I Do. I Do Not Want Suggested Post In My Main Feed. Make It So I Can Filter Them Out Or Completely Remove It.",positive
"Very good app, I have just joined. I have liked it very much and all other people should also download it brothers. Well done brother!",positive
Just signed up to threads like it the only thing missing is widgets to be able to see it on the screen,positive
Works well & I'm enjoying it so far. There are a few features I'd like them to add in the future.,positive
12m downloads in very less time is just amazing. Let see how this apps works. Am just looking for one thing. Does this app offer freedom of speech? Because meta did not but Twitter does.,positive
Would have rate it a 5 if the reels options in Instagram were available and some of the Instagram features,positive
"It has been a very successful application, it has a few shortcomings, but I think they will be completed. I loved",positive
"It's good, I just need my in-app name to be independent from instagram, aswell as account switching",positive
"It's just like it's rival but , it lets you automatically follow your Instagram followers/ following.",positive
Just way more user friendly than twitter. Easy to sign up if you already insta as well.,positive
It's kinda slow when it comes into unfollowing people. I've unfollowed one account twice but it still appears that I'm following her. How ridiculous 😂,negative
Not able to find direct sharing options from insta or auto sync as what I expected,positive
"Need #hashtags, $cashtags, search function for text, bookmarks, DMs and draft functionality to make it remotely usable.",negative
trash app. theres no settings and missing very basic features.,negative
I have a problem where I rethread mark Zuckerberg post and then it simply looks there two rethread in my timeline even though it is the same post. Hope u can fix it,positive
Felt kinda comfortable in this app! Don't knw why but it's friendly and kinda better than Twitter.,positive
Having Glitch on my account Interfreace that is not showing things clear like full page is shaking and being blury so please look at it...,negative
I can't believe I'm giving 5 stars to a Meta app but it works as described. And every star helps Elon to be a bit more miserable.,positive
"Good app, nice features.... Now underrated people can get some reach without reels.",positive
"Good. But if follow several people at once, always showing restricted massages. That's nonsense",positive
Unable to upload pictures. The app keeps crashing.,negative
"Keep improving We need to edit post after posting; spell mistakes, auto correct and change of mind etc... You know 😉",positive
It's really a nice app and will beat Twitter but the issue I'm facing is profile picture syncing issue,positive
"Need dms , dark mode and save option like Instagram. Or else it's good.",negative
Installed today 6th July 2023. Threads is currently tied to Instagram account. But the link to Instagram and Facebook should be optional. It should be a standalone app like Facebook or twitter.,positive
"The issue was finally fixed.... woohoo 🎉 I feel like kissing you guys.....but lol that'd be thru the phone, great work!",positive
Glitchy on my device. Can't view anything. It just goes double-triple vision,negative
Too much of glitch. Can't use The app at all as it glitches continuously.,negative
Develop the best space than that of Twitter and more other cool features but its so cool Ctrl+C & Ctrl+V,positive
Hope you got the user name you wanted on Instagram. This feature less app can't do anything... All account stuff is run through insta. DOA.,negative
"Threads is a new app, built by the Instagram team, for sharing text updates and joining public conversations....",positive
It's glitching. Texts are cascading over other texts and pictures,negative
"I can't post pictures, it's keeps crashing when I choose pictures and press done",negative
"i hope... with this new apps, my store can increase revenue, branding, and productivity. 5 Stars For META, Cheers Universe.",positive
We are the early users of Threads app. I want our next generation to see this review and know that we were the early users of these threads apps but after I joined these threads apps I will add many memories with these apps which I will miss a lot in future.❣️🥰🧡,positive
"When I scroll down or up, my whole display just messed up with the letterers. Fix it ASAP @Mark_Juckerburg",negative
It's taking many permissions and while using heating the phone. It's a trap for looting data,negative
Why am I opening another app to connect more app. To view the same things I would view on the previous app pages?,negative
"A great alternative to Twitter, filled with a fun community and is very safe for people.",positive
I wish it wasn't a separate application and was connected and inside Instagram!,positive

"Please fix the feed , there's some people facing me every time when i enter the app , i need to see what i follow,not suggestions please!",negative
Not optimised upto now... Screen continuosly blinking and flashing.,negative

"Everything's cool. I think you should just introduce the ""trending"" in your features",positive
"99% of the content I see are from accounts that cross post the same empty platitudes, engagement bait, or junk news on every site. The rest are influencers who I nor anyone have ever heard of. I still see new posts by accounts I've blocked. This app is a ploy for Zuckerberg to take over the Fediverse, but currently it's complete garbage. This app will not cultivate a real culture in its current form. Even the influencers themselves are complaining. Draconian Meta content rules still apply.",negative

Nothing new.. just changing interface of insta.. n launched for making money only not entertaining..,negative

"Such a worse experience with this app, What else can I expect from Meta 😂 Lot's of bugs and issues...",negative
"It's too worst because when I started it, it started to shake screen And I was just seeing the blurr screen",negative
"It doesn't make sense that I have to delete my Instagram profile to delete my threads profile that's so unfair, and it absolutely doesn't make any sense. I'm gonna uninstall and go back to Twitter because at least I might have limited tweet views, but at least I'm not being held in a hostage situation on it",negative
Easy to manage very simple to sign in easy on my eye love it just want to see reach of my posts,positive

"Absolutely Amazing, it's like a golden egg for Instagram users !!!",positive
Was hoping for something like Twitter but it seems like Threads is great for advertisers and brands who have proiority over normal people. American commercialism and full of people saying the right things...,negative

app not working display open when display shade more than three time app installed Android version 9+,negative
Interesting app and so much potential. Love that it links to your old Instagram profile. Meta should add cross sharing posts from insta to threads and also easy switching between your different Threading accounts eg personal profile and business profiles,positive
"Easy to sign up, and follow people from Insta with a click.",positive
Not working at all...app is crashing a lot can't see any posts,negative

Barebones so far too many posts I see from strangers I don't follow. But I see this might be a app people use,negative

Wish there was an option to sign on or set up profile without Instagram.,negative
"Very bad experience, poor, it can't be application powered by Instagram",negative
"App keeps hanging up, no update nor solution. No inbox/DM nor hashtags",negative

Am I first one to write review???? Good app... may become more user friendly interface after few updates!,positive
Really creative and ensures seamless communication.,positive
Good so far but my app crashes halfway through typing a post every time,positive
Dont automatically add instagtam followers please. Also If one worked for twitter it doesn't mean Elon owns you forever. Nice to see people have a choice.,positive
Can you also make threads lite? but it should be version 5.0+ btw i love this app 👍👀 we can use it for sharing photos videos and much more.,positive
Fix your app its glitching so much. I have reinstalled still not fixed,negative
So far it is like a skin for Twitter with the Instagram server but this runs well for a newly launched app.,positive
Idk why but the I am suffering from glitches whenever I am opening the app... It's not working properly,negative
It is better if there is a translation feature in the interaction between all in the threads🤍⚜️ community من الأفضل ان تتواجد خاصية ترجمة في تفاعل بين جميع في مجتمع threads🤍⚜️,positive

"nice but what is the idea of the T-naming? Twitter, TikTok, Telegram, Threads. is there something you're not telling me?",positive
Just copy the Twitter concept with low UI and features quality as social media app.,negative
app can login with instagram but not with facebook and gmail it needs to be fixed . please Please 🙏,negative
"Just waste of time, no creative updates could add a value!",negative
Requires Instagram account. A new creepy way for Zuck and crew to harvest/sell your data.,negative

Best yet. Would be nice to have bookmarks and markdown writing...,positive

"So far so good, giving 4 stars because I don't know everything I can do on the app just yet. Still figuring it out.",positive
Just a barrage of brands peddling the most saccharine trash possible. No way to get rid of it and just see who you're following.,negative
There is a problem with the video they are always mute 🔇 we have to change this situation to have voice,positive
Having an issue with this app very vety annoying (your thread failed to upload) I mean this particular issue Overall its okay,positive

"no way to get a thread noticed, like a hashtag or anything. so unless you are a Dlist celebrity, this app is turning into a waste of time",negative
"Doesn't get past the terms and conditions, just sits there loading.",negative

As soon as I select a picture to add post the app is closing immediately 😕,negative

"Trash apps, don't use it cz its collecting your private information and its copy paste twitter nothing new.",negative
Great App Overall. Won't be long till it overtakes Twitter,positive
God where are all these negative reviews coming from? The app is not even 3 days old. It's not going to have exactly what everyone wants. I think improvements and features will get better over time..The reviews where people are saying they can't sign up or it's difficult especially when they already have Instagram is laughable to me. It took me 1 minute..,positive
this needs a chronological feed free of algorithm-suggested posts or else I'm never gonna use it.,negative
"The motto is ""say more"" .... But only in 480 letters. Really? Say more, but not much. Even in this app review I can write 500 letters. How I can describe my opinion in 480 letters? Increase it or bye",negative
Keep getting fail to upload have cleared cache but still not working,negative
Needs DogeCoin payment transaction! Everything else is almost an exact copy of the competition.,positive

It's an amazing app Simple and clean Hope the voice goes loud 📢,positive

JFC SHOW THE LATEST NOT THE CURATEST. The app is good but stop assuming my news feed. Do better,negative
"Not working properly, all sections are getting disturbed",negative
Threads works fine like Twitter. Easy adding friends from Instagram.,positive
I don't have IG... So I can't log in? Please change this setting for thus who only want few apps. Thanks!,negative
Wth is wrong with this app??? It showing glitch pages .. it doesn't deserve even a single star,negative
Need to make it so we can delete the app without deleting our Instagram accounts or you'll lose users/not gain them.,negative
"This app is very cool nd its features is very easy to use nd name is osm(Threads). Now we will replying to anyone "" Main Use Threads Kr dunga""",positive
Very competent but doesn't do well with the details,positive
"Wow this is very awesome app compare to all other app. I pray That like all apps in the Meta family, it should be number one in the world. From today I am a member of the meta family.",positive
Please give the option to see followers only posts as well bécause all I'm getting is posts from ramdom people and on the topic I'm not interested.,negative

Still need a lot of improvement can you upgrade apply a google translation/translation,negative
Doesn't have hashtags yet. But otherwise it's looking great!!,positive
It's a good app but no free speech. It sensors and removes almost everything including memes. Why would you sensor our opinions and want us to accept opinions which are against the basic truth? It's sickening 😒.,negative
Very good but need to improve more. I wish it should no be routine social site. Something new is expected,positive
App Doesn't work properly.. Showing some error please fix this problem,negative
This app is very sweet and nice. The funny part of it is that it's easy to gain followers,positive
"I can't login, it keeps showing '' an unknown network error has occurred''.",negative
"When i log into threads, i get logged out of instagram. When i log into instagram, i get logged out of threads. Stuck in infinite loop.",negative
I rather see Instagram get separated from Facebook. Its still Facebook to me.,negative
You guys need to add trending tab and DMs and this app is perfect.,positive
Crash every time. When I open it and scroll,negative
The apps is great! But why do i always force close when i click on Threads coment?,positive
It crashes. It is difficult to follow news.,negative
Would like to only see posts from people I follow. Otherwise it's just as messy as Twitter.,negative
This app make my display overlapping but its not fault in display!,negative
"Please any bug in application, my device all text always move, thank you",negative
I can't even open a page properly I just installed it andbits glitching,negative
"I want to read stuff only from people I follow, not some random bs from random strangers.",negative
Worst app. Bad UI. unable to recommended. Bad work by Meta. It sucks,negative
Useless app don't even bother wasting your space and wifi with this bs!!!!,negative
"Display overlaps with old, scrolling doesn't work",negative
App keeps crashing and bugging at the home screen,negative
I have never used Twitter so I can't compare but man it is annoying that 90% of my thread is full of stuff I didn't ask to see.,negative
"An app with an unique thought process, smartly developed..",positive
Just joined it but looks like nice and smoothly working AAP but still lot to done on this AAP.,positive
They should really add a feature to search for threads and also possibly add hashtags,positive
Keeps crashing when I try to add an image to my post and at random,negative
Much heavy bugs like I'm not able to scroll my follow request section in infinix note 11 please check this app again with you developers,negative
EASY TO UNDERSTAND UI. GOOD TO BE ON A NEW PLATFORM.,positive
I've just opened it and it doesn't work it gaves me like Screen tearing and I can't use it please fix it,negative
I don't see the point of this app. Like a boring version of the boring Facebook and Twitter apps,negative
"Congratulations for putting out this app, and may the further development be in haste. Can't wait to see this app be built up.",positive
"This app is amazing.To be honest, I don't use Twitter but when I tried this,I can't imagine how addicted I am right now 😂",positive
This is an awesome App and Definitely a good competition to the other app...,positive
Something like the app is Glitching or crashing in Dark mode ... Need dark mode update version,negative
"Unusable mess, literally cannot read/see anything because of a bug",negative
"Implement the ""following-only"" feature then this app would be perfect.",negative
So far this app has been better and more enjoyable than I ever thought it would be. I'm excited to see how it evolves in the future.,positive
I don't think it's a new app I'm a Quality Assurance engineer software's I seem this app same as Twitter with different name n logo also there's a bug init,negative
"It's cool but same as Twitter,but there should be extra ordinary activity in threads....",negative
It looks like I can get Threads only if I already have Instagram? I've never had Insta and don't want it.,negative
I keep crashing while typing a thread and it's really long and now gone,negative
I hope you never place ads on this platform. It's good as it is for now.,positive
Great app very easy to connect with your Instagram account,positive
"Lacks alot of thing like themes ( contains a single theme ), you can't DM anyone , and etc",negative
*can't edit past posts (esp. wrong spelled words) *don't know why can't upload other pics (pic size?),negative
Pointless app. Looks very much like Twitter without the engagement.,negative
Everything thing is great but please add dark mode I am giving it 4 stars because of dark mode Else it is great,positive
App screen lag when I open.. Please fix this bug,negative
"As usual, no followers no use, no one using it in the feed, despite a seamless launch for once",negative
There is a bug if you activate your Insta account on thread than you are not able to delete your Insta story,negative
Great app so far. Simple. Just need to adjust few thingsm like right now we cant read other quotes replies .,positive
Worst app please don't download Instagram users you'll loose your Instagram account and can't use it properly,negative
Would be great if it didn't throw up error message on my first attempt and wouldn't let me use it at all,negative
I think it's better than twitter but adding chatting option will be good for now.,positive
it's pretty fun & you can post whatever you want & follow your friends & keep up w them. : ) 20/10,positive
Early rating. Still a lot of work need to be done. Like the look of the app.,positive
It's high on ping... downloaded twice still the app is glitching,negative
Hard to find the people you follow as it just gives you hundreds of random posts.,negative
"no DMs, no hashtags, no feed in chronological order, no trending topics, buggy AF, and trying to delete threads profile will result in Instagram profile being nuked, pffffff",negative
Finally found an app that doesn't immediately go away from what it's meant to be 10/10,positive
Needs a lot of improvement...app crashes on my android..,negative
Ok so this thing is just like twitter but it's a mix between Instagram and Twitter Real impressive in my opinion,positive
It's fantastic but it's not showing how much reach your post got like Twitter,positive

Not working words are overlapped in the feed post.,negative
All features are best but i can't send message to new threads friends🥲,positive
Crashing every time I try to add a picture.,negative
Feels like using a cheap version of Twitter. If meta was so eager to Create something like Twitter then he should have tried to buy Twitter. Just feels bad with this app.,negative
"It's simple because it's so new, but I'm liking it so far, and I can't wait to see what new features get added in the future",positive
"Should also add other like features like linkedin has (celebrate, love, laugh)",positive
While scrolling the entire app becomes glitchy. Can't even use it,negative
Feed is cluttered with posts from accounts I don't follow and most likely have no intention of following.,negative
"another meta app stealing data and private info even without option to opt out, its no replacement for Twitter, and should be banned",negative
Frequent to crash everytime. Fix it!,negative

A new social media app yet you can't even do a hashtag? A one simple thing that all of socmed has even Facebook and Instagram yet there's none in Threads. Like what?,negative
The app is incredible..but I have a problem because i can't see my followers and those following me,positive
"Lots of Bugs. Firstly, No dark Mode Secondly, no edit option of pic while posting. etc.",positive
No widgets? Really? Have a scrollable full screen widget.,negative
"I am having some issues,like I can't scroll the page....it is like some bugs I feel....",negative
"Whenever I want to read something on it and reply to it, this app closes and says there is a bug in this app?",negative
I can't find follow requests sent to me in the ❤ section. It was there but than disappeared? I am very disappointed with it,positive
very useful till now. the only thing i miss here till now is saving photo.. please add this option,positive
This app is COMPLETELY UNUSABLE on my Xiaomi Redmi note 7. Hope a fix is coming soon.,negative
"Unable to use Instagram, after download of this app Instagram was not working in my mobile",negative
Continuously Force closes when trying to upload posts.,negative
This app is the best app ever... Kudos to you Mark but the app needs to have DM and Verification requirements,positive
Very good this app but this app in privacy seen for example location photo etc. 😆😆,positive
The app is randomly crashing when attaching a photo,negative
"So much spam. I go to a popular post and 70% of the replies are people saying to do 'x' for $5,000 or proving links. It's a ton of spam and bots at the moment. Makes me sadly go back to Twitter for now.",negative
I have noticed some bug on this App...... Clear the bug I have to review it.....,negative
Tried to change my username through Instagram after I was done the app didn't work again.,negative
The app is good but if we can message each other it will be much fun to use,positive
"uploading picture caused the app closed immediately, fix it",negative
"Allow us to use multiple accounts at a time like ""switch account"" and also add a ""like section"" where we can see what we like or how many post we have liked.",positive
It's glitching way too Much plz fix this app or update it as soon as possible,negative
BRO..THIS APP CRASHES A LOTT..I MEAN..AS SOON AS I OPEN THE APP..IDK WHAT HAPPENES..EBERY BUTTON OR TEXT OR IMAHE START OVERLAPPING EACH OTHER OR SOMETHING..IDK BUT THIS JS HAPPENING WITH MOST OF US..FIXX IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE..WE CAN'T DO A SINGLE TASK WITH THIS GLITCH..I WANNA CHECK THE APP AND ITS FEATURES..BUT THIS SRUPID GLITCH IN FRONT APPERS AND DOESN'T END,negative
App crashes while attching pics. Fix this pls.,positive
Please add “follows you” behind their username so users can easily distinguished who are their mutuals.,positive
Great app everything but there shoud be an option where we can message other users,positive
"laggy, can't even scrool without letters overlapping, can't read anything",negative
Not an independent social media. All related to Instagram. Even account is created with Instagram details. Can't deactivate account without deactivating Instagram,negative
Excessive amount of data it requests and also shares with 3rd parties. Copy cat of twitter. What happened to Facebook I wonder.,negative
Great app. Please add feature to search stocks by $SPY etc,positive
It's crashing every 5 minutes. What kind of behaviour is this Mark 💀,negative
so clean! i love how minimal the monochromic color pallete that was used.,positive
It's just a poor man's Twitter or a what Instagram would be like without pictures 😭,negative
Worst app all are uploading same content in Instagram and threads why can we watch same content in 2 apps ?,negative
We're 100% happy for this beautiful work 😩😂 Freedom at last 🌝🤝 Looking forward for great and amazing updates 😌,positive
"Seema really biggy and broken right now. Will update if they fix it but right now, not really there .",negative
UI looks interesting. Missing #trends option.,positive
Installed this app and it's full of glitch. Don't know what to do and how to fix this.,negative
Not at all optimised for some low end devices. Very disappointed,negative
Very shady privacy practices. Can't even delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account.,negative
"I accidentally remove the threads badge on my instagram profile and there's no way to recover it back :-( Can you please solve this problems ""hide badge"" thingy. Can you please put or add ""unhide badge"" on instagram so that I can really enjoy this app.",negative
"Clean, fast, straightforward. Everything that made Twitter fun before Elon",positive
Sign up at other communities with Lemmy. You don't have to give your info to Meta. This is their scummy attempt to steal your data as part of the fediverse. You have alternatives which don't attempt to scrape your phone.,negative
"Good one. A good chase to the bird... Keep shining, good luck.",positive
This app is great so far for me it's better than stupid twitter the ui is nice there's little to no bots you don't get any of the dumb people so far and they actually take moderation so far a little better than twitter actually allowing things instead of saying existing broke guidelines garbage,positive
I request to all team of threads that please don't give a option of reels and any video.,positive
Shows following once and then immediately switches to complete strangers. Worse than twitter,negative
I can't see text and when i see some text double when i scroll,negative
So far the app is nice ...u gat ma five stars .... Its interesting ❣ But at least limit on the restrictions time 😤,positive
Nice 👍 looking forward to see what they add. 1st time experience was good 😊,positive
An excellent start but there are thing to improve like add tranding page,positive
The app crashes when creating a thread with pictures.,negative
It's great but it's left with a trending chart,positive
Best but need to edit option when photos uploaded with captions,positive
"Great app, but it needs dm's and a save feature.",positive
Awful experience it just lag every second you touch the screen,negative
"Hello, Everything is excellent but I'm unable to find Trending page",positive
"So far so good, just one quick question, in months to come will this app offer useful tool to people looking to be content creators influencers etc ?",positive
App is glitching at the first time itself i installed should clear the bug,negative
Very bad...no option to show us what's trending like Twitter. Not use hashtags.,negative
The screen is flickering inside the app what to do ?Please solve this issue,negative
Gathers a ton of unnecessary data + can't delete account without deleting your insta account.,negative
"When i start use this app my instagram crashed and i cant go to the home page anymore, now im using instagram lite because this bug, anyone facing the same thing?",negative
Great alternative to apps like Twitter. I actually enjoy it way more.. somehow different,positive
"So bad , I didn't like it at all + please either delete the whole existence of this app or make some good updates ASAP!",negative
Continually crashes when trying to post photos,negative
Its Good..... It is minimalistic and simple yet very pleasing,positive
the app seems pretty great but it stops every 2 mins or so,positive
"Feed not works here, the screen is stretching, no usable",negative
It glitches alot!! Can't see anything. Worst experience.,negative
It's a good start but they have to add some thing before it can be great: 1. They need to add an option to see only people you follow instead of an annoying algorithm. 2. They need to let you mute all posts from languages you don't want or not know. 3. They also need to add option to change the name without changing the Instagram name. 4. Another useful think would be the ability to zoom on an image and staying zoomed without it snapping back to normal size. 5. They need a website.,positive
"It's probably the newest comment To the future, uninstall Instagram it's addictive quit ciggerate call 911 life is meaningless joy till tomorrow, cause you have to go to work Search new job exams are over don't know if will pass FM",negative
Really threads with the app not showing clear result on Nokia 8,negative
"Garbage copy of Twitter. It's basically twitter but way worse. Personally, I don't like copycats and this is why threads Has already failed.",negative
App is not working properly we cannot even open the app,negative
Nice new App could do with alot more features but i think it will get there,positive

"I can't upload photos. When I upload photo, the app closed😔",negative
Need more features and better data collection policies.,positive
I really love this... At least there's another room for opportunity... Twitter ads are cost . And getting engagement could be difficult.... But welcome THREAD....,positive
"I like the design ngl. I had trouble with twitter, I hope thread can fulfil that.",positive
Worst app with lot of screen flickering and very slow,negative
it is a problem bug. And black crash screen,negative
rendering too many times whole ui is fluctuating.,negative
It's a good social media platform this app may be helpful & easy to work it.,positive
"Just a bloody copy of twitter, It's the exact same thing but worse, Wouldn't recommend supporting these kind of clone apps",negative
So far enjoyed so much. hoping for more new features. its like tweeting with instagram✨,positive
What is this?? If i don't have an Instagram account i can not login to Threads?? Why??? Just accept that we need a less toxic app than insta that's the reason we stayed on twt all this time. And now Threads won't let you login without insta account?? Thats not at all fair,negative
This is a good app and nice competition to it has very good potential to grow,positive
"Intresting ui,no bugs easy to understandand easy to interact with our community faster Good effort by team @instagram @meta @zuck",positive
"Need more like downloading pics, dark mode, sharing post with other social media.",positive
A lot better than Twitter. But it would be better if you didn't have to log in with Instagram,positive
"Nice interface, Hope doesn't change your mind in interface in other update .🙂",positive
It always crack when I start scrolling the screen.,negative
Very good experience and UI is outstanding.,positive
"as boring as twitter, if you create a new social media app, make your algorithm fix first and make all your user have a better number of views and likes",negative
"Add more features plsss. Like edit button, and etc..",positive
you need an account from a different app for this app. that makes no sense. also the website doesn't do anything.,negative
app closes whenever I try to post a photo. Please fix it.,negative
"It started out great, but now I cannot even post my threads anymore, the app refuses to upload my threads🥺 I'm going back to twitter now😪",negative
Crashes everytime I try to attach a photo.,negative
Its good smooth but should have to add module for edit post,positive
"Crashes every time I try and leave a comment, so frustrating to use",negative
Threads batch remove instagram then not a 2nd time not appicable this not good aap please this option able to threads,negative

App is getting crashed while uploading the specific images.,positive
Good app with better ui than twitter...though twitter is more maimstream app and it will be more authentic like it was...,positive
Very easy to use better than twitter you can share with any one and you log in with your instagram you open the app and you see your account on instagram you click it and you just log in and when you open on you instagram profile you see threads picture and anumber behind it the number is your turn of installing threads easist and best app in 2023,positive
Still missing some features. Hopefully they'll come soon.,positive

"useless, can't even change name or username other than Instagram.",negative
"Good, just needs a following feed and a home feed. That'll boost it to 5 stars",positive
"I'm finding it hard,even with the correct login details",negative
I love it so much easy to use and connected to Instagram perfect ♡,positive
"Every positive review you see that only says ""Great app! 5 stars!"" Or ""Love it"" etc is actually just a paid for bot account out of China or India. Zuckerbucks is a tool and buys and sells your data with every facebook/Instagram/threads profile you use. Just....don't. Wake up people!",negative
"Feedback on current version 1)You should provide story option for this app 2)when we do search , no results",positive
Lacks a trending page but otherwise a smooth & likeable app so far,positive

Lacks basic features. No trending topics etc,negative
Only thing I’m loving about the thread app is no messaging feature. Only threads. Keep it simple please 🤌,positive
Consuming more time !!😑 Not user friendly UI,negative
Amazing!!! I want to be a part of Threads and help improve this app!,positive
Flashes a black screen and then closes instantly,negative
Love it! One thing that I would want in the app is direct messaging,positive
Unable to log in after logging out to switch account.,negative
Will this app beat Twitter?? Joke of the century !! worst site wrost performance wrost experience. I will surely go with 0 star ! And Uninstalling the app,negative
never got rate limited on Twitter cuz i couldn't stand the app for more than 2 tweets,positive
it would be great if you'd allow us to make more than 1 thread account like you have allowed us to make more than 1 insta account all on the same app....,positive
Crashes constantly when trying to upload images,negative
I think it's linked with a an app called *'Sure Fixed Matches'*,positive
A copycat of Twitter. Great that it helps to filter & clean Twitter's environment from those that're not belong to Twitter💁🏻‍♀️,negative
"Nice sleek app, like it's competitor but with a better user experience",positive
Well something Interesting after a long time for starters it is basically Instagram with some add on's,positive

"No issues so far, doesn't look the best but it works fine.",positive
Amazing app but there's always room for improvement and development,positive
It's a second rate twitter basically looks to be a rush job to take on twitter,negative
"Half polished knock off app, doesn't really add any value over competitors",negative
Want to see what its all about but app keeps force closing when I'm typing something for some reason?!,negative
"I don't use Instagram,i deactivate my profile!!! Why can't I use threads separately! Atleast give an option 😒",negative
"Am I suppose to have Instagram to access this app ? This is nonsense, I don't like Instagram and I won't install it to use another app , nothing good comes from this all he thinks about is making more money",negative
It keeps crashing the moment I open it I go back to my home screen,negative
App is not working correctly it blurs all posts and letters,negative
Nice app just I want dark mode option data saver option and once time threads edit option,negative
It's a good app But it should have trends to make it better and data saving option,positive
"Nice attempt on copying Twitter but I find some things not so comfortable in this app. For example, I can't separate posts in a feed between recommendations and my follows. It's just a huge list of endless publications from people I don't know and don't care about. Also it would be great to have ""save media"" button.",negative
"Desperately needs a ""following only"" feed. This sucks so bad without one.",negative
"No volume, everything keeps glitching, Twitter is better.",negative

"This is a fun app, but I want a page to show what only the people I follow post.",positive
"The app is glitching, I reinstalled it multiple times but still the same",negative
Nobody engages with your posts on this app and you are not able to delete your profile. No longer interested in using this app.,negative
I'm all for sticking it to Elon. Can't wait until new features are added.,positive
The app defitoo addictive ❤️✌️ Thanks To Mark for this.... But would really appreciate if we could send DM's it,positive
A few minutes in and I'm already loving it. Can't wait to see how this will rival the bird app.,positive
Super app and instagram is very very good what will be very good threads now and there is no better app than this i do it a lot thank you Instagram ❤️☄️🎶🎧💌🌍🤞🏻,positive

Why the hell ppl I don't even follow and am no interested appear on my timeline? Everything is shoved at me. It's annoying and confusing,negative
Another way for meta to track you. That's it. They saw a gap forming in the industry and decided to take more for themselves. Meta very nearly has a monopoly on social media and is known to nab everything from your device they can just to sell for profit to unknown parties.,negative

Much like Instagram, it's going to show you celebrity content first. Just mute those accounts and seek out the content you want. Politics? Start with news orgs, then move to journalists.

It's a good app but no right to free speech in the app,negative
bug and glitch are disturbing while i'm scrolling on it.,negative
Very good for simple social media apps category ⚡,positive
Why is it necessary to have an Instagram account to open a threads account!? I don't have insta. So I will never be able to use threads!? No thank you!,negative

Excellent customer service and support I just love it,positive
Smooth use and great features.,positive
I'm one that I didn't hate or love Twitter. But I thought I would try this out like the other social apps recently. And Threads has it right it's easy to use and I like that you can just use all of you just snyc all of your IG followers. They have that info anyway. The only thing is there's not very much socializing Yet.,positive
What a laggy app...after longing the screen goin freezed....pls fix this up,negative
App is glitching. Not working in my device 😔,negative
You must have an Instagram account to get this. There is no way to just build an account on threads!,negative

Threads app Very amazing my feelings is Very good i have been used early morning I think so these is very good aap,positive
"Ugh, Mr. Zuck collects too much personal data with this app. Let alone all the political bias on his platforms. Stay away!",negative
I will give it a five star....It's easy to use and the developer did a very good job,positive
Threads is a very good app i love it and i use it instead twitter and u can find you'r instagram friends in it,positive
This app is nothing special other than hiding and filtering the truth that must be known u can not express ur opinion freely on here and the home and the idea is all a taken idea so I call it a copy paste but I give it a F because the filtering is making my blood boil I want to have a free opinion,negative
It's a good app but it should have included polls and hashtags,positive
Doesn't work properly Whenever I scroll it started glich in it .,negative
"Overall, ‘Threads’ is awesome. But I want to ask, when Threads is powered by Instagram, why aren’t Instagram followers being transferred to ‘Threads’?”",positive
My experience are so bad and worst experience in this app 🤮🤮🤮😠😠😡😡🤬🤬 this is very bad application please don't install the app,negative

"It's not as good as Twitter, but something new from the meta is welcomed.",positive
Soo dark. Also it's like an unlimited message just bombed on ur screen,negative
Yeah! Here is the new Social Media Application by Instagram which is something cool and interesting one to share your Thoughts & Views..... and what not.....😇,positive
Garbage app. You'll never be good at anything copying someone else. How's that 1 billion a month going with the metaverse? 😂😂😂 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️,negative
I was very excited to use this app. Love it more than Twitter <3 if it has trending section.,positive
I installed it but I am not on Instagram and I don't want to be on Instagram.How can I sign up without having to create an account on Instagram?,negative
"Zuckerberg finally gets his act right. Excellent twitter spin off, much better and surely a necessary competition in Musk's monopoly with twitter. Can foresee threads replacing the popular app soon!",positive
"I don't have control of anything.. I can't even close my thread account without closing my Instagram account.. Please, come Blue Sky, I really hope you're what I'm looking for.",negative
I know it's early but i already love it. Hope they will put an edit option though.,positive
Average at best. Needs a lot more work,negative
"It is continously crashing on my device, Redmi note 8!",negative
i can't save images. So why would even want to use this compared to Twitter,negative
Don't use this app if you installed this app and log in with Instagram id your not delete threads account. If you delete your threads account than Instagram account also delete.,negative
The app keeps removing and crashing in android 😠,negative
It's a W app but taking time to refresh maybe cuz it's first day and too many people are using it,positive
When i tried to post a thread with picture it not responding and going to home automatically 😶 worst experience,negative
Seems like I'm the first reviewer.....let's see threads look way better than Twitter with good infuncer support.... gonna rock🪅,positive
Not the greatest could be better. The fact so many accounts exposed how many fake bots they have and ai responses is sad. Fundamentally lazy app,negative
"The best app and the best alternative for tweeter , now Twitter will come back to their position, and also the first review on threads app",positive
Nice app.. but crashing sometimes and plz add DMs!!,positive
app crashes instead of loading stuff 👎,negative
"Another Amazing One, Let's TryIt And Come Back With The Real Review. 😍😍❤️❤️ I Love It,",positive
"Honestly this app is till in its testing stage, bugs on top of bugs",negative
I can't use the app at all. And it's also not opening well.,negative
Handling reports on Instagram was awful and it will definitely be worse in this app,negative
"5 stars because its new... But.... Im using a Samsung S7. And when i try to make a thread, my keyboard blocks the make thread button. Or im just really dumb. But the keyboard wont disappear = cant post thread.",positive
Can't create an account in app. Instalock on instagram.,negative
Amazing app like a Instagram and same as Twitter. Enjoying for using this app. I recommended you may download now. ✨,positive
"So Many Bugs. When i tried to Replying Other people Post, it keep 'force close'.",negative
Worst app. Nothing fun here. Collects user data without you even knowing. Drains battery.,negative
"I believe it will be a good application, there is much more to be done, but it was a good move from Mark.",positive
It need to be more optimizable and lite.,positive
"App is not running properly, glitches",negative
Mine isn't functioning well.. It's hanging words are writing over each other,negative
Very familiar like tweets you can use. And connect with Instagram and experience your threads also connect with your if followers is cool . Best of luck of good reach for thread,positive
"It's a great start! I do feel like when adding photos we should have the ability to choose what album we pick from bc I have a ton of images on my phone and scrolling to hunt for them in 10k images isn't fun. Also I feel like there should be in app DMs as that's part of what makes things like Twitter so usable the ability to talk to our friends about threads or post. To what I DO love is the ability to add more than four photos at a time, the ability to write long multi post threads.",positive
Hoping this would be easier to use than Twitter. But it's more difficult,negative
Add feature for saving pictures and video,positive
That's a best platform to be connected with your own Instagram and use Twitter as well😉😂,positive
Bad app freezes all the time,negative
"Instagram becomes the another version on TIKTOK and this app called ""Threads"" Becomes the another version of Twitter.",positive
Cool! Totally improve then twitter when create some thread more simple I don't need to post-> reply -> post,positive
The UI is interesting I think it will replace twitter soon,positive
Best thing about this app is staying close with my friends and family,positive
"Bad thing is that if we delete or deactivate th thread app, automatically instagram will deactivate 👎👎",negative
Too many bugs yet to be fixed 😕,negative
Good and easy approach for Threads platform,positive
Only issue is that I haven't figured out how to filter out threads from accounts I don't follow.,positive
Usually bad .. post doesn't edit very poor update.,negative
"So far is very nice, but I am hoping to see integration of hashtags like twitter",positive
"Easy as hell to access, simple, easy to manage. Day 1 and I'm sold",positive
Loving it so far. Would love an edit feature tho ❤️,positive
Crashes several times when I open any thread...,negative
"App is crashing, can't post or comment on anything.",negative
Pretty good as of now. Keep it good so we'll move from Twitter to THREADS!!!,positive
lol I get bug although I restart or also restart phone it keeps it problem,negative
Unstable homepage... Can't see any content,negative
App is getting crash while opening user replies,negative
I liked the concept of the app. It is truly competitor of Twitter,positive
I'm tired of reading cringe tweets from blue check accounts that are trying too hard to farm engagement.,negative
NO BODY will see your posts if you haven't any followers on instagram already! Totally useless. I'm unistaling this.,negative
Missing a lot of basic features,positive
I have a issue to upload pictures there is some glitch 😕 you have to update the aap to resolve the problem my threads I'd 5587922,negative
Very beautiful It is considered a strong competition with Twitter,positive
"Nice for now. I hope it will not become twitter. LE: now I have 'something went wrong try again' and I can't see comments, page and profiles..",negative
"Not able to poat anything amd change my profile pic, it says your thread failed to upload.",negative
Great app but I can't see the views count on any video,positive
The only issue I have is there's no follows tab so the feed is cluttered I don't want me feed full of celebrities I don't care about,positive
please stop the auto play of videos and reduce the app size,negative
"Welcome to woke twitter, plus more data harvesting for Zuck.",negative
Literally it gives a great experience It is more better than any social media app,positive
I thought it's a chating app but problem we can't delete because my insta I'd will deactivate 😔😔,negative
Lacks so many basic features of a discussion platform,negative
"It doesn't work properly, crashes",negative
Why anyone wants to see same thing which is already their on Instagram? Linking with insta is the bad decision.,negative
I've been using this app for few hours only and it starts glitching.,negative
"Very good app, but it keeps crahsing now. That has to be resolved.",positive
I'm worried I can't save videos or pictures... that's a problem though,negative
Why my app keeps crashing while uploading my photo? Please help,positive
"This app is to clear and smooth, please don't start ads on this app",positive
Why I can't have access instantly from one acct to other? Do I need to log out everytime?,negative
I mistakenly hide thread from main Instagram page can I get it back on my main Instagram account 😕 if yes then how . Direct connect to threads 😞.,positive
Many Bugs Including Sudden App Crash In Certain Threads & Sometimes It Says Content Unavailable,negative
Why doesn't it have a dark mode??? Needs a dark mode.,positive
Not working properly and I can't see what's on screen,negative
"Best App, please provide hashtag follow option and also provide recent option in search section",positive
Terrible App ... crashing every 3 minutes,negative
"Ok great app but, maybe let us save pics and videos?",positive
"it keeps bugging, i can't read post from my phone",negative
Very useful and convenient app in the world,positive
Fix the damn replies it crashes when I tap to open them,negative
Very good but service needs to be improved,positive
"algorithm sucks and no ""not interested"" option.",negative
The app is good but it lacks somethings but I think it will be done in the future.,positive
Very basic. Third rate Twitter knock off. Just get Twitter.,negative
If you copy something at least make it better than the original. This is utter rubbish,negative
"very cool twitter substitute keep it up meta, don't keep developing the metaverse tho",positive
"Please add ""confirm all"" button for follower request. Thanks",positive
not properly functioning in android version 9,negative
Clean design and glitch free so far,positive
Im so loving it! Still exploring while enjoying it! 💙,positive
Twitter sucks and is for the MAGA Repubs. This is a great alternative. <3,positive
Minimalist and clean UI Design,positive
"I get the idea of competitive marketing, but making it this aggressive and making me have to delete my linked instagram to threads. U get one star",negative
Very poor service not usefull Twitter is very good better service and New update..,negative
"It's very simple, boring, and boring.",negative
A promising competitor to Twitter. I just wish there's an option to hide threads from people I don't follow on the news feed.,positive
"I'm currently using my Lenovo Tab 4 8 to join Threads. At first, the UI seems it's not optimised for my tablet, it's just glitched out and can't read any threads, making it unusable. I think the UI is only optimised for phones, and not tablets. I guess I'll be using the web version of Threads (if it's available) until you fix the UI. Also, Threads functions like that one bird app where everyone is literally angry about, and yes, Threads is like an alternative to that app!",negative
"It was enjoyable up until the point where I signed out of my account to create a dump account with my dump account on Instagram and immediately saw the error notice. I waited as instructed, which was a few minutes. Few minutes has passed and still got the error sign. I deleted it and tried again, but the same thing happened. Currently, I'm VERY CONFUSED.",negative
"The user experience so far so good, clean and neat, and easy to navigate through, my biggest problem with it, that there's no Dark Mode so far, and the people following you can easily find and follow you back, which is a thing that I should choose instead of the system choosing it for me, I acknowledge it's an Instagram App, but when it to comes to the user choice, it's better to let the following stuff up the users themselves, not automatically you find the same list migrating to threads..",positive
"100% unusable, the posts and texts on the timeline overlaps (like constantly scrolling & overlapping the post like hundred times) make it not even readable. Bugs? super bad UI? not fully developed app? IDK, I'm using Android OS 9, ram 6Gb, maybe they develop the app for the newer version OS first. Unfortunately i can't send a screenshot. Anyway, completely inoperable, uninstall immediately.",negative
"I have 2 instagram accounts and I used my alternative one for this app. After few hours, my instagram app kept crashing whenever I switch into my main account (that's not connected to threads) but it's fine if it's the alternative account I used for threads. I kept on uninstall and re-installing, clearing data, and such to fix the bug yet no changes happened. Please, fix this.",negative
Non-linear timeline and buried in inline ads,negative
"Really not that good. It seems like it was released before it was ready. Very unintuitive. Accounts blocked on Instagram still have easy access on Threads. The time line, or whatever it's called is just a random blast of the most basic, Access Hollywood celebrity press releases.",negative
"It's not quite ready to launch yet, I had download/install this app as soon it came out so far so good nothing Hasn't been crashing, and etc yet but after few days give it like 2 days for it to start crashing and etc. But I had deleted the app to see would it stop but I don't know if it would. But I gotta feeling it's a problem with the software. And it started to crash today like I can't thread a post but it doesn't show a like when I had liked a threads but I can't comment on their threads.",negative
"I recently had the pleasure of using the Theard app, and I must say, it has completely transformed the way I communicate and collaborate with others. easy-to-use , user-friendly ! *In next update please add the option of adding more accounts like Instagram & double tap to like the threads etc...*",positive
This app sucks. It's key problem is that it CANNOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT DELETING INSTAGRAM. Do not download this app. I don't see many people using it either. It asks for many permissions when creating an account with no warning that you cannot remove the threads link from your profile or delete your account. It's a data miner with no benefits.,negative
"It's a twitter killer app, it's kinda fancy but then its major downside is its limitation to the Close Friends list, potentially restricting the user’s reach. Also, as a separate app, it might require users to switch between main Instagram and Thread apps to access the full range of Instagram features. So to me it's a 4star app",positive
Please make feature that makes me can see post only from people i follow... too much post I'm not interested in my timeline,negative
"From the stunning visuals to the endless array of creative and engaging and interact with people, Threads is perfect for those coz has it all. Also the layout is perfect designed, the functions and options are good developed l. Feed personalization could be better... Pls check it's not good like Instagram .. In short thread is awesome than the twitter😀 Regards from, Zanzibar, Tanzania🇹🇿, East Africa",positive
"Hey Creator, Is there any problem with threads it's not running in my phone! The homepage of thread buffers and all the texts, posts etc overlap each other. I have tried all the possible things like reinstalling, rebooting my phone, etc. Please try to fix the bugs. Thank you!!",negative
"Very simple, sweet, easy to use and everyone is nice. Could use some things to help organize it like a media tab or a ""following"" feed or maybe more ways to customize your profile like a banner but overall it's really nicely put together and honestly very approachable. 10/10 for a new app",positive
"Meh. I really wanted a good alternative to Twitter but this isn't it. The UI is pretty basic looking and there's just no settings. It starts showing loads of threads from people you aren't following and you can't stop it. It's basically always stuck on the ""for you"" section on Twitter.",negative
"So many issues. I couldn't see my own profile page, other people page, my replies, notifications, etc. The only thing working for me is the feed, which filled from a bunch of accounts I'm not following. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still runs into the same problem. I'm using Google pixel pro.",negative
"Upgraded to 5 star cause meta team heard my complaint as soon as I reported it. the bug I've experienced earlier before the update was fixed already and I can use the app now normally no matter what the theme is. however, it looks like the update was only intend to fix the bug issue + performance improvement and nothing more. anyway, the app looks nicer now and smooth after the update but, surprised to see how rapid the ratings of the app recede in a couple of days after the launch.",positive
"It's not bad but it has some way to go before it can compete with Twitter. For me personally the app is just too basic and lacks features. Also, not a fan of not being able to register via email rather than through instagram. Obviously it's still early days but I'll be uninstalling for now.",negative
"Overall it's a good idea, but I hate that it only has a for you page (so you have to see everyone's posts, not just those you follow), and that your account cannot be deleted unless you delete your Instagram account, too. And once you link your ig account, you can't change your name, username, picture, or bio unless you change it on instagram. It'd be a much more enjoyable app if the two weren't so tightly connected and if you weren't forced to see posts from people you don't like or care about",negative
"The app closes/crashes whenever I try to attach an image to a thread, I didn't have this issue yesterday when I downloaded it. Uninstalling the app for now until it's resolved. Also I don't like the algorithm, hope they fix it cuz it shows threads from people I don't care about 😬 With lots of improvements, I know this app will be better.",negative
"Within two hours of having the app, I had to deactivate the account; it messed with the security on not just Instagram, but a couple of other apps on my phone as well. I will NEVER recommend this to anyone, not even an enemy.",negative
"I had to reset my password to deactivate my Instagram. When I reactivated it, I couldn't log back into threads because the password had been changed. Uninstalled and reinstalled, app kept crashing. When the app actually worked it was one big endless thread of people I didn't even follow.",negative
"Everything seemed fine, some little glitches when needing to verify my account but the problem started when I went back onto Instagram and couldn't access my homepage as it was replaced with a while screen saying ""Welcome to Instagram. Follow some accounts"" while giving me suggested accounts, treating me like a new account. I've deleted both apps multiple times and restated my phone, worked for a little but now back to how I mentioned. A real pain, I've sent complaints but nothing yet.",negative
Too much bug detected... Not usable.,negative
"This app is NOT good at all. Do not waste your time trying to make it work. The algorithm is the worst recommending stuffs that are completely different from your insta account. It seems like people are just tryif to use the app, but there is nothing really interesting A complete waste of time. I'll stay in Twitter btw",negative
"I have Twitter, and hate Musk, so I thought I would give this a try. No way to sign-up. Just tells me to log in with my Instagram account. Never had one, never been on Instagram, and I have no interest in creating one. Would have given it a shot if it didn't ask me to create this account on a different data stealing app. But because it did, I just deleted the app.",negative
Right now it is better than Twitter and better give a update to download photos in Instagram we can't so here it is better,positive
App is glitching too much i m not able to use it posts are flying i hate it 😭,negative
This is fully bugs in open app I waste of my time and my expectations and net,negative
Threads team Add photo and video download option and add save post option also Upcoming update Thank you 😊,positive
"A platform to stay positive and find happiness at minimal things. Threaders Unite! Don't know for how long this positivity will continue to exist but right now it is at its optimal level, #KEEPONTHREADING",positive
The best platform and the most used platform is much better than Twitter😒❤️🍷,positive
"I use an Android phone, using all other meta apps currently, this app has issues with interface, when windows got stuck and we would drag a dialogue box it created multiple lagging images, same thing happened with the entire feed as I was scrolling, even after restarting the app.",negative
Good app absolutely good from Twitter best place to follow people and make a social relationship with them,positive
"For a just starting app, it's suprisingly good. Like astonishingly so.",positive
Lack of search option makes it less Twitter-y!,negative
It was very good app and it will definitely break Twitter in 1 year,positive
"Like a simpler Twitter, and don't you have to pay to consume content!",positive
I didn't know I must have an Instagram account to access threads. Lemmie stick with Twitter for the time been.,negative
very bad app please put options to delete account permanently...,negative
This app is facing massive glitch. I installed this app 3 times and I even rebooted my device but it still didn't resolve the issue. I can't even scroll properly even after refreshing my feed 5-6 time. I was pretty excited to use this app but my experience was ruined. I am highly disappointed with it's user interface,negative
"theres a text limit up to 50 characters only, i cant write freely because of that, sue it",negative
"Havent been able to use it since i dl it, just keeps saying sorry, something went wrong 🤷",negative
User friendly app with good interface,positive
At the moment the app locks users into specific agreements and features with no way to opt out later. The environment ruled by policies that effect ordinary people's ability to share their hobbies as well.,negative
Tried of login page error showing every time,negative
I liked it's user interface. Easy to use. I liked it very much.,positive
compatibility issues in low end device especially even my device,negative
Great...no subscription or limitations problem,positive
App is very good but keeps crashing.,negative
"Thread is As same as Twitter , there is no any inovative thing occur. Thread team must have to improve the user interface",negative
It is a very unique app in terms of design 🫡,positive
"It's just better than twitter,Instagram,facebook and even telegram 😂❤️",positive
"It's not ready yet. I'm not sure why people even spend time on it. I chose pages and people to follow, but my feed showed everybody. I muted a bunch of feeds with no success to clean it up. There needs to be a feed tailored to Followed pages and people. I'll return to Threads when that is implemented.",negative
It's literally a poor rip-off of Twitter with more questionable data ethics (more tracking & more of the censorship industrial complex).,negative
This is awesome application by meta. I really like every functions in this app,positive
Great interface and user experience,positive
All applications of Meta Company are very beneficial for business. Thank you!,positive
Add Trending option and hashtags option. Please update logo like what's show in app logo in colour and logo in colour is better than Balck and white. Please update logo and update app,negative
Nice app for sharing thoughts and ideas.,positive
This is better than using tritter even though i haven't used twitter but I give Instagram and their new app Threads 100/ 100 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😊😊😊🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗,positive

Fantastic easy to use . Easy terms,negative
"I've tried various photo-sharing apps, but Thred stands out from the rest. Its intelligent thread suggestions and tagging features make it effortless to group and find photos. The threaded conversations create a narrative around the photos, making them more meaningful and memorable. Thred has become my go-to app for reliving experiences and sharing stories with loved ones. It's a must-download!"" Remember, these reviews are fictional and provided for illustrative purposes.",positive
"Needs more features. You can't search posts. You can't use Hashtags. If you have a lot of Instagram followers, then chances are you'll have threads followers. Otherwise, there's no other way to get followers on here. I hope that you develop this app furthermore.",negative
"The app was working fine earlier, now I can't even log in :')",positive
Good start .. Needs widget and some improvements,negative

"Nothing special than Instagram, I don't think it's necessary to keep this app other than Instagram",negative
What is this app trying to accomplish besides being a Twitter clone as soon as they started limiting users? Meta would rather jump in and create a new app for that scenario then go on about making their already existing platforms better. Guess blue checks sell more.,negative

At the end of the day, both apps are terrible.",negative

Didn't seems like good.why u both are practicing competition when both have big jaint company.we are tired to using those,negative
This is totally wrong.. We don't get equal Opportunity in threads. I mean to say that i big creators who have already good amount of followers on instagram are getting more and more followers on thread due to your one function which is follow all yhe following list of instagram account. That not correct and equal competition for the new users who want to grow on thread. Please make change in this and give equal opportunity to all the users on threads platform. Thanks,negative
"I'm sorry Threads. The algorithm is too boring. You push too much local content. The forced contents couldn't be more different from my taste. Twitter algorithm didn't push me local content. Twitter lets me see exactly what I want. After 2 whole weeks, I guess it's time to just quit Threads. The algorithm isn't worth it if all it does is push celebrity accounts, when I was never interested with them in the first place.",negative

UI is disbalanced in vivo phone And app is good,negative
Unable to open the app!,negative

This is not best application for Instagram reel creators Because algorithm is not same A reel creator upload reel on Instagram and get audience what he do in threads How to they get audience in threads ?,negative
This app a lot of work to be done on it so it will be better has Twitter e.t.c pls work on the message box,negative

"Please fix , any in android version have bug when scroling thread 🙏",positive
"Is this supposed to replace Twitter?? 😂😂 Lmao 🤣😂 very unresponsive app, makes you feel like your screen is damaged",negative
Sucks so far. I only want to see accounts I follow and 95% of my feed are people I've never heard of or don't care about following. I'll try later if/when they fix this.,negative
Creative idea .. easy to use .. simple .. it will be revolutionary,positive
I have just downloaded it and I think it will be a great competitor of Twitter,positive

No way to create account rather than Instagram login.,negative
Great experience people need app like this thank you so much team lots of love ❤️,positive

Trash Trash Trash!!! Let us delete this app! Holding us hostage by linking it to our Instagram page.,negative
Laggy n buggy ...it needs to be fixed ..,negative
it's glitching a lot everything is overlaped to eachother,negative
"Nice application, but I hope that I can return my threads account number in the Instagram bio, because I deleted it and I cannot return it",positive
Woul suggest adding an option to save photos and videos,positive
Another left wing controlled app. I'm deleting and uninstalling. 🗑️,negative

"It has a lot of problem with persian (farsi) language but except that one thing , it's incredibly good",positive
I like this app so far. It needs a dark mode option.,positive
"So far, so good. The engagement far exceeds other social platforms, just in the first day I'm using it.",positive
Its good but needs improvement and its too similar to twitter,negative
Bad app Can't open a new account on this app I recommend don't be install this worried app,negative

It is better if the messaging system is enabled in the software.💬,negative
Not working full of glitches in ui.,negative
"Photos failed to upload, reason not known? What to do?",negative

"Very good app entertaining , knowledgeable, interesting..",positive
Very Nice app. The app is very familiar like I've been using it for years.,positive
Its an amazing app .. congratulations Instagram ✨ but i still love insta more 💗,positive
"You can't only see stuff from people you follow, it desperately wants you to see Ellen DeGeneres and Eurovision posts and there's no way to switch that off. It's like what if Twitter only had a For You tab and was run by the second worst person in the world instead of the worst person in the world.",negative
When I open the app I get graphical glitches with the text,negative
"I'm just scrolling it and checking it, till know it looks good.",positive
I can't get in. I don't have an Instagram account and never wanted one.,negative
I can't open this app... Showing lots of bugs,negative
"Love it, about time, let the bird fly away adios goodby.",positive
"The app has a lot of potential, but it's a great start.",positive
Fix the glitchy screen as first as possible 😡,negative
I love the karma bots giving the app glowing reviews like they do with every app no matter how bad or outdated it is. I can't use Threads on Tablet or log in. It's not ready for Android. Besides the only way to close your threads account is to delete your ig account as the two are linked. Other option is to create a new ghost ig account just to use this app.,negative
"Crashes every 10 minutes or so on Android 12, MIUI 13",negative
Home page crashed as soon i opened the application,negative
"So far, so good. Simple and easy to use!",positive
"Sadly just more Meta garbage. Censoring and jailing galore as is the standard with Facebook community ""standards"". The figures quoted of all the millions of new users to the platform is completely inaccurate as 99%+ are already Instagram users so this is hardly anything to brag about NEW USERS 👎🏻 I registered a new account to test Facebook and Instagrams ""standards"" and was immediately blocked with 6 months to appeal. Total bogus rubbish built with Copy & Paste",negative
Does not have hash tag search option. You can't search trending hashtag. Trending hashtag must be there.. Poor Copy of twitter.,negative
when I try to upload photos.its close without any reason,negative
In my device crash app while im typing thread. Why?,positive
"Its nice and very loving app My question is this,how do we message each other and talk to each other over there",negative
"Downloaded and linked an account from Instagram and the threads app caused my Instagram app to crash within seconds every time I tried to open the app. Uninstalling the threads app fixed all the Instagram issues I was having. Wild considering it's all one metamess, you'd think it would play together well...",negative
The Codeword is the only one I can find for Tahir is the only way for us,positive
Awesome option this is. Everyone like it. Just awesome. And thank you for this option or App 🤗,negative
Very smooth and optimized app than Twitter,positive
"Despite Hiding word like Crypto and NFT, i still het related pages and posts containing those words. With twitter the mere mention of ganes would gift me pages that post things related to that, but threads gives me celebrities i dont know, influencers and cryptbros. Please make it more user friendly",negative
Please include following feed feature and save feature in this app,negative
It's easy to used this app. No hassle nice one Meta to develop this app.,positive
"Completely devoid of Twitter blue virgenes, and their moronic takes. I'd give it 10/5 if I could. 👏🏽 💯",positive
Glitching up so hard right now made a screen recording if u need i can email,negative
"Don't make an account if you intend to delete it after because this app doesn't provide that. Once you make an account, you won't be able to delete the account completely without deleting your ig account. Home algorithm also meh, this app doesn't care to ask what your interests are. They just shove all accounts to your home even though you don't follow anyone. This app also put that @numbers to your bio, which annoying and can't be hidden. I really hate my decision to make account, deactivated",negative
"need for features like able to add gif, able to see how many people reposted, how mamy people views the post, and so on",positive
Wow 😲 very good features ☮️👍 nice Thank you so much dear instagram and threads team ❤️,positive
Many glitches like overlapping screens and it feels like your device is dead,negative
error in log-in? I'm not even log out my account. What is happening? there is other account which is changing my password? Like? seriously?,negative
Unable to upload an image.,negative
Crashes a lot - Not user friendly,negative
I love Meta App. Its a fastest and trending apps everyone uses it . Love u meta,positive
The app have alot of bugs i can even use it at this point,negative
It won't let you delete your account without deleting your instagram!,negative
"I have installed today It's looks like instragram twitter alternative app, I don't know how was that my experience",positive
"timeline is just random people I'm not interested in or follow, what's the point?",negative
I am facing an extreme UI glitch in my Android phone,negative
Needs some more years to be perfect.,negative
Keeps crashing. Can't post,negative
It's some error to watch some videos.,negative
It's the best public app. It's really better from Twitter!,positive
"Probably the worst app by meta so far. The app is glitching out big time and laying over texts that it looks possessed. Can't even see anything, would add pictures if I could just to show how horrible it is.",negative
"Clean, refreshing but confusing",positive
This app is so osm for more information about my knowledge 🫡👍 & very easy to login 🥳🥳👏👏 too good,positive
Why doesn't it have private inbox?? It looks nice but on the feed we should just be seeing posts of people we follow,negative
Allow users to register on the app without necessarily having to operate Instagram. The current model is intrusive. It hard to anonymously use your app like one does on twitter. Delink registration from Instagram. That's the primary reason why I uninstalled the app without registering. You're making it very easy to trace people,negative
This apps is one of the best latest app for advertising,positive
A trending topics tab would make a great addition to the app,positive
Hybrid of Twitter & Instagram please try to change interface 🥲,positive
"The moment I finished my login, the threads(?) on the page immediately overlap with each other. Same goes on search page, profile, and notification. So it create some kind of ripple threads. I wish this review page have a way to post my screenshot to explain it better. I hope you can improve that and I'll change my review the moment it works for me.",negative
Great app but it should have a trends for you click,positive
Need to improve interface,positive
You can't just simply rely on instagram influences. App totally sucks,negative
"Concept doesn't really work well, just a worse Twitter",negative
Its not good at all. Thread creator should have to work on this app thanks. Regards andrew tate fan,negative
"The people complaining about the censorship forget that this is a company, and companies run based on capitalism, so they will do what they have to inorder to keep advertisers. Aside from that it's working well so far, I just block what I don't wanna see and curate my timeline to myself simple as that.",positive
"Add inbuilt Bookmark feature to save, a thread or post within app , so that we can check it out somewhere",positive
I have been use Instagram since 2016 but none of my reels have gone viral till date.,negative
"Since the day I have downloaded this thread my instagram is lagging too much, I am unable to open my instagram 😡",negative
Too Much Bugs Screen is Flickerring,negative
Ok first why this app glitches a lot? Like I can't even scroll the screen,negative
Best app but no language translate future available...,positive
"It's new really good app 😀 but Elon musk, Twitter master copy😹just for fun .❤️ love app❤️",negative
"Twitter uses to be enjoyable until it is handed over to Elon Musk who made some unnecessary changes that force people to need its substitution. As the results, many quit Twitter including me.",positive
Good application but option to translate instagram threads should be given please,positive
"Suchit told me about this app, i was shocked about what it was, haha twitter will bear a bit loss...",negative
"Poorly executed alternative to Twitter... Typical Instagram/Facebook ""forced algorithmic feed""...",negative
So far so good. Add more features and it will be the best.,positive
I can't wait to leave Twitter... But why do I need an Instagram account? I'm an old millennial - can't you just include an email sign up instead to win this market share battle?,negative
App got an update and fixed everything.,positive
The best app rather than Twitter!! I love it and need to improve something,positive
Time taken to reach 1 million users: Netflix - 3.5 years Twitter - 2 years Facebook - 10 months Spotify - 5 months Instagram - 2.5 months ChatGPT - 5 days Threads - 1.5 hours (king 👑),positive
It's don't allow to share videos ...It is not good 😕,positive
eehh fine app eh looking really sharp looking good look at your app shiny,positive
"Poor copy of twitter, so many features lacking",negative
"Easy sign up, easy invite to friends!",positive
Unable to add images.,negative
"Please 🙏🙏😌More Updated this app Recover Post option Not Available, & Edit option not Available, more Improvement.",positive
Imma rate this for the future to see date downloaded 7-07-23 app review so far soo good mark and elon musk supposed to have a fight but ended at mark making this app to rival the twitter elon have 😩😩,positive
Overall a Good app Need Reel section for this app Add the gif option for Google board,positive

Good for threads (another tweets). Need more features.,positive
Unable to use dragging issue,negative
Super aap easy access user friendly,positive
Provide an (accept all / confirmed all ) option to accept followers request for open account on treads like Instagram ( anyone can follow open account without admin confirmation). If an account have followers in thousands or millions then what will he/she do ? . Should he/she click on confirm option for thousands or millions times to accept followers request,positive
Much needed solace from the bird experience....,positive
"I like this app. However, can you just give me one more chance to unhide the Threads badge on instagram, please 🙏🏻🫠",positive
It's really beautiful I love it so much but I hope it doesn't stop working,positive
There is a bug i found after I opened and refresh it,negative
The app crashes whenever I open it,negative
I can't know how to use it but it is from Instagram well it can do something like Twitter ✊,positive
"Clean ui, but sometimes its failed to load someones threads",positive
"Lol, experiencing using this apps, and couldn’t getting code.",negative
Absolutely fun to scroll for hours and hours!,positive
Would give five if it didn't keep closing when I'm trying to type a post!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
I DON'T have an INSTAGRAM account. Finding difficult to login.,negative
"Great app, user-friendly, approachable vibes, and straight-forward on use. I prefer the approach of this more than that 'bird app'. Although I have a request, please enable app cloning and/or multi-account log-ins, thank you! And utomatically hiding like counts is faulty.",positive
"Similar to Twitter, but 1- No option to create new account (just connect with insta) 👎 2- Cannot delete threads account without deleting Insta Account. 👎 3- No Hashtags 👎 4- No trending Stories 👎 5- No Chat /Personal Messages section 👎 Simply going to uninstall threads. Bye bye 👋",negative
One of the best apps thank you Meta for the ease of working with threads,positive
"Buggy at the moment, I've not been able to post pictures.",negative
"It was working well, but now my followers ain't showing on my profile, and I can't see other people's followers",positive
"I thought this would be nifty and I would be able to create an account. Surprise! Unfortunately, that was not an option as my phone number was required that signified I already ""have an Instagram account with that #."" I did not want to connect to that account and I REFUSE TO SIGN UP FOR FACEBOOK. SCR3W YOU ZUCKERBERG!",negative
I didn't find anything unique. Just an old design.,negative
Alot of time I reported my thread app not working. I still facing the problem,negative
"Good, Hopefully it will be better than twitter but hashtag system should be included",positive
Its good experience to threads and good effort for meta team but this step might be crucial more in future but i have confident on you that you will be consistent on your goal❤,positive
It's a great app . But it should have live broadcast.,positive
"Its name should be Changed like , Hey hi or easy type",positive
"It's fun, until it's having a bug",negative
Need some updates 1. Switch profile 2. Upload videos 3. Make its own settings 4. Feel like Insta so need some updates to make its different @Threads pls work on it 🤞🙏,positive
it's a ten but there no translation T.T,positive
"Really good app, ngl. we just need DM!!!",positive
"It's a good app. It's not as optimized as Twitter yet, and that's fine. You can't expect Disney+ to be Netflix since day 1. Twitter has perfected their craft since over a decade now, and they still keep destroying it.",positive
The app can't be used without Log in with Instagram,negative
"At first, I used this app, everything was okay. But, yesterday, when I wanted to open my account, it said that someone had logged out my account and said that maybe the owner had changed the password. I never logged out and changed the password. Hope you have a solution to this issue. I don't want to lose my Instagram account because of this.",negative
I'm satisfy with this app I mean it's a new app but I feel like I use this app from so long thank you meta.,positive
I'm not a big fan of it because it locks up and doesn't update.,negative
I downloaded the app but it wont work smoothly on my phone and my andriod is version 9 which means it compatible for it. But any time i want to scroll through the feed the writeup get clumsy together and the text and images start shaking...how can i rectify this problem?,negative
Oh my god 🤣🤣🤣 damn it.... Twitter and threads like to same of lag performance...hmm not interested by threads,negative
Simple and less bloated,positive
"Perfect for anyone who wants their private info taken, their behavior modified, and their thoughts censored. Just look at the permissions list and read some news about how Facebook censors people just for disagreeing with the government or large businesses. If you use this app you are volunteering to be part of the system.",negative
Good app but it's working against twitter so there is no improvement.,positive
"Good app 👌 Nice UI , nice features 🤗",positive
"Competitionk is fine, cheating is not It’s all about Ctrl C and Ctrl V..",negative
If you want share your ideas with text and present you point of view you can use this app,positive
Very good app We need just a message option,positive
Very nice app i have grow 🪴 this app i think Manny reward please take Manny every users thank you God bless you always,positive
This app is glitching for me and I cannot see anything properly,negative
"This is the new app of Instagram, competitor of twitter. Elon musk vs Mark Zuckerberg ...What a rivalry!!",negative
"The more you praise this app, the less it is because its features are amazing.",positive
Doesn't work. Display is corrupt.,negative
"I can' t signup new account, need to install instragram something.",negative
Am I really the first one in the world to write a positive review on this app!!! Love it! It's a love at first sight 🤩😍,positive
Threads is as nice as Instagram...!!,positive
"Twitter lookalike minus some features like DMs, explore, views etc. Your feed will have more content from people you don't follow. Basically people/brands with the blue tick! The reach, algorithm must be on trial phase rn & won't be surprising if it favours influencers! It would have been good if there was segmentation of threads to keep track, given it's marketed as conversation app. As it will add more features, it'd soon become another Twitter. You won't miss anything if you aren't on it.",negative
"same content and user base as on insta, what the difference of using this app???",negative
Attempt to increase Instagram users. I won't be signing up,negative
"App permissions more intrusive than a colonoscopy, way too many ads and was shown toxic content. If Instagram is cocaine than Threads in meth. I was hoping for better but got shown the worst parts of IG. Couldn't delete this app fast enough. Unlike Threads, Mastodon is advertising free, run by non-profit groups and doesn't track you like a parolee with a GPS ankle bracelet.",negative
"When I download it and want to enter the application, it tells me that the application has an update, or the application is updating ????",negative
It's working for someones favor! And 100% copied from Twitter!,negative
It's full of glitches and errors,negative
Incredible application just it needs some features,positive
It crash when trying to add an image to my threads,negative
this new meta app is very use full please add reals option in this app ❣️,positive
It's meta and there's no desktop access,negative
"Very nice app, but can anyone tell me how 🤔 to unhide the ID in insta???????",positive
Decent app so far would like a option to edit posts after posting,positive
Please bring messaging options and chat themes.,positive
the app is rather performant and feels like Instagram. But nice app.,positive
Just include hashtag & Trending features. It will be better than twitter,positive
"Much better than Tw(a)tter, the blue bird😸😸😸",positive
Love this app Instagram account @inspired.version @motivated.bible @motivated.scripture,positive
Best option for sharing knowledge with public on social media.,positive
A very great app 💞💞.... Fast and reliable,positive
All the post are overlapping its like an hallucination worst app .,negative
"It is a good app, there are no problem and bugs.",positive
"So far, I like this application. It could use some features like gifs, maybe live stream etc. The tweets aren't repetitive as you scroll your feed, unlike Twitter, and it seems as though you can see everyone thread who posts on the platform, which is cool. Makes following new people easier. So far so good. I'm a meta Share holder too so with this new app I'll be buying more stock options. Lol❤️😀😁",positive
Lot of bugs in login Followers are dead Which is not active automatically get 150 followers without any close friends,negative
Worst experience ever. They are trying to replace twitter but they didint even try to facilatate .,negative
There is a bug. Its like infinite words...,negative
Facing a glitch.... Just not working... Kindly do something,negative
"Worst app, 😭 fully glitched screen.",negative
Works like charm. Need seperate login feature.,positive
so sweet threads an i always support this app in any condition so thankyou very much,positive

"Hi, I'm the first person who rates the new instagram (Thread) a better place to discuss.",positive
Need to switch between multiple accounts. Need post translation.,positive
"When I open this app, my display starts blinking",negative
"If it had the ability to hashtag and space like Twitter, it would be great.",positive
Unable to receive an OTP for forgotten PWD. Check this part please. If you wish to compensate me for this finding please reach out.,negative
"nice app. meski fiturnya masi terbatas, i'll stay pasti kedepannya bakal update",positive
It's so sleak and smooth. I love it.,positive
Nice but add a trending page and hashtags,positive
Nice app best app 100 by 100 threads And Twitter app is so cheap 100 by 8.5,positive
really disappointed with this app didn't enter app and fully bug,negative
Its good but by mistake i logged out my account and now I'm unable to log in again 🙁🙁,positive
Had more glitch 😔😔😔 Can't even open the app,negative
"Can you add the translation feature? Also, when I search for something I don't want accounts, I want threads or hashtags",positive
"The app is too smooth , DM's should be introduced also",positive
"The app is great but not for those who have the version below android 9,, cause whenever I try to open the app.The app's home page becomes glitchy and scramble,, So this is a matter of regret to the meta authority that they should have be more senciere before launching the app,, though its a bug associated problem,,,,",negative
Really need to put download photo features,positive
Look like tweeter Small brother . But good in experience I prefer Threads . Rivalry on 🥶,positive
Love this app! I prefer it to Twitter. Thanks Instagram/Meta!,positive
This app work very slowly it's not like insta or Facebook,negative
I think this platform is contivity with Instragram but here no options for story upload and others.so this is using like Twitter and we threads here like our thoughts or other 👍,negative
"Can not make a 1st time account, it just ask me to sign in using Instagram that I do not have on my phone, SO HOW TO MAKE A ACCOUNT?????",negative
"After downloading threads,my insta account is not opening since yesterday evening.",negative
"This is amazing,app that Way better than Twitter,hope y'all added good things",positive
"Unintuitive UI. Restrictive functionality. Content basically mirrors Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. This is not exciting and new, it's just a business venture! Same old social media yawnfest. When is somebody actually going to break the mold and make something fresh?",negative
"Very buggy, I can't view my page",negative
There's is a huge bug in this app . Everything is just jumbled I don't know how to explain it .,negative
Its a very cheap app dark mode are not supported 😒,negative
Loved the minimalistic interface,positive
The app is crashing many times,negative
Not working in Android pie (9),negative
It is a ripoff twitter it looks and feels the same as twitter,negative
"I'll continue using instagram and WhatsApp cause they're good but Threads is not fun to use, rather use twitter",negative
The app still needs work. All I see on my home page are blue checkmarks and random influencers and brands I am not interested in. It gives the vibe being a twitter only for brands not a place for normal people. It would be great if posts were in chronological order and only see the people I follow and to include a trending page. With all the issues twitter is facing this app is still far from being a twitter replacement.,negative
"Exactly like Twitter in a sense of posting thoughts, feelings, memes, and promotions, but different in a sense that I have yet to see any pop culture drama, I have yet to see any discrimination, or cyber-bullying. Threads is safe so far!!",positive
"Brilliant, I'm glad there is something better than Twitter available to use.",positive
App is crashing when I try to post picture,negative
New and exciting for a change from the twitter bipolar energy.,positive
"Tldr: Twitter 2.0 by Instagram Great app, I won't use it very much though",positive
All Good But Please Make Space Option Like Twitter.,positive
"Every time I try to post a new Thread post with a new pic, I get kicked out. EVERY TIME. It's BS.",negative
This is very osm app ..plz launch the feature of trending hatstag etc,positive
Instagram account homepage has been dysfunctional post installing and creating a profile on this app.,negative
This App is one of the most wonderful App were I can be me without be Sher I love this App but the only question now is Who is the third3 person to be on this thread App please 🙏🙏,positive
"It has twitter and Instagram mixed vibes, i like it.",positive
This app is garbage doesn't even open most of the time,negative
The only problem i had has been solved thank u souch meta. Shows your awareness towards your users,positive
Very buggy... the feed wont load,negative
"Worst than Twitter that's for sure. Alot of critical feature for an social media are non existent. Like seriously, this ain't the 2000s anymore, and sure as hell this ain't facebook, stop putting random people's post in my tread that I didn't follow, it's just worst than advertising. I will only come back once you guys implement a ""core"" feature such as being able to view your following people's post first like Instagram or make it as a seperate page in Twitter. Jeez old man...",negative
Very slow when browsing,negative
Chat options not available Its very bad,negative
I want a standalone app. Not another data sucking child of Facebook!,negative
It's crashing when attaching photo,positive
such a buggy app... videos don't play sounds,negative
"Like twitter but with less bots, less creeps, less nazis, less scams, less pdf files.",positive
"Dreadful. Functionality clearly needs more months of testing. No DMs. When writing a message you have to manually scroll the tab down to see what you're typing. No trending or subject matter. Its just literally your newsfeed, which is a disorganised mess and filled will memes and crude behaviour. Nothing value additive. It's a glorified version of Insta. Pass.",negative
"We have to keep in mind that its the initial stage of the app ,there will be bugs glitches ,and crashes. But one thing we can't deny man this blew up ,like people rushed to threads like ,fathers rush away to get milk (kidding) but the best thing about this app is no cheap theatrics like you can basically buy blue ticks (for a monthly subscription) [musk-the-mugger]. Its a platform where verification will have a value and importance not like Twitter.",positive
"No web version and we must have Instagram in order to use it that is BS and the functionality wise very basic version of Twitter.. At least try to accommodate some of the great feature of Twitter,and call it Beta version to stop getting bombarded with the negative reviews. Good luck,Zuke.",negative
"Well designed, easy to use, but it's refusal to allow any content that could be labeled ""nsfw"" makes it an easy pass as a true Twitter alternative. Political or personal opinions aside, without some sort of option to allow content in that category, it will continue to needlessly kneecap it's self. No normal person is going to use both apps, and way more then are willing to openly say it will continue using Twitter for this reason alone.",negative
"too many bugs , but i still love this apps.",positive
"This app is really great, anyway How do I translate other languages ​​to English? Is there an option for that in the app?",positive
It's really cool I can't understand it a bit But it is very cool I really loved it 🤩,positive
Why don't you give us an option where we can see the posts of people only we follow and not n number of random meaningless stuff in which we are not interested at all?,negative
Threads (Tweets) loading is very slow 😞,negative
Extremely poor. Just copied twitter. World don't need this app.,negative
U should get emoji's on the like button like on facebook it would help us alot,positive
"Hiii, could you please add the See the translation, thankyou",positive
I thread to download on my infinix hot 10 but didn't open,negative

Too much data collected without reason.,negative
I am very sad . Chatting features is not available 😭. How can talk to friends 😔. And Now am very upset 😤,negative

not optimized for rtl languages!,positive

It's OK but it's crashes to much,negative
Wonderful 😊 but black screen bug,positive
"Very bad experience, App not tested properly, after login everything starts to jitter on the screen everything overlapping please improve this, because instagram works perfectly fine on my phone but in threads i cannot read a single word also after login, because screen continues flickering and splashing, i cannot post screenshots here otherwise would have posted",negative
A really good alternative to Twitter. Meta taking over social media one app at a time,positive
Crashes every time I select texts,negative
Nice but the data charges are high,positive
The app takes too much personal data to run an app.,negative
"Terrible ui, buggy , slow,",negative
"When they first revealed the app, we thought it had potential. But it took only 5 minutes to see that.... NO. It's really just Instagram for tweet-like texts, and, like Instagram, it shows random people all the time. It really doesn't try to do what Twitter does, it's just Instagram",negative
When install the screen is blurred like when I scroll the posts are overlapping,negative
I give it four because threads are getting back after I viewed it 😮‍💨 but almost it's a great app n the best app used 🤞🫶,positive
Very good. Not alternate for Twitter its another More than Twitter,positive
Force close when uploading an image,positive
It sucks tbh. Logged in here using one of my Instagram account idk why that account isn't working anymore.,negative
Not stable continusly lacking over screen,negative
There's no delete option and if I had to want to delete my thread account I also have to delete my Instagram account. This wasn't expected from meta,negative
I used redmi note 5 pro. In my phone it doesn't work,negative
i really enjoy to use threads 🔥❤️😚 team Meta thanks 😊❤️ you for launching this app.,positive
Hi team This app is laging on my phone freezing pitcher and text please help me out thankx,negative
Okay app is pretty good but definitely needs work.,positive
"Can't sign up, only allows sign in with Instagram....",negative
"It works, but the home feed is nothing but strangers talking about stuff I don't care about. I would prefer to just see posts from the people I follow. That's why I follow them. I like the lack of a trending tab, but I see no point in using this app until the home tab is cleaned up and we get a followers view.",negative
There's a bug guys whenever I try to open my recent Follower first thread the app closes on its own,negative
Its not working and glitching,negative
It's not working properly please try to fix it,negative
"VERY NICE BUT PLEASE, ADD A SWITCH ACCOUNT OPTION!!!!",positive
This is a poor imitation of Twitter. The app isn't good and it isn't fun at all.,negative
"Device model Asus Zenfone Max Pro m2 :app is lagging, ui is getting overlapped",negative
This is a great app but please fix the glitching 😊,positive
I have had to report a system failure three separate times and I haven't received any response. I have also noticed that comments on my threads have been reported but I'm not the one that has reported them. Either I've already been hacked (it's only been about a week) or there's a lot of glitches that need to be fixed but either way I'm really frustrated with the fact that nobody has gotten back to me or even attempted to fix my problem.,negative
"Wanted to spite Elongated Muskrat, instead forced to sign up for Instagram just to log in, instead of just a regular sign in prompt, not even a Facebook or Google sign in option. Y'all need to learn from PC gaming that no one wants a dozen different launchers or logins for something as simple as this.",negative
It has no Dark and Light Mode options,positive
Hopefully it will make a place in people's minds as an alternative to Twitter. I downloaded it last night. I will give the rest of the review after use.,positive
I Have Few questions we can't use the HashTag Here.❓ can't we use the Dark mode? and can we see the quote posts. Seems No⁉️,positive
Great start for a new platform.,positive
Very Nice .. but can you make the app ato rotate,positive
"I love how fluid this app was, why don't do the same thing with Instagram tho..",positive
Bugs bugs bugs everywhere there's bugs,negative
"I would like to see posts of people I FOLLOW, others...not really. Also can we have dark theme.",negative
"So I have to have Instagram to be able to log in and use this?? No thanks, you can go get fu@#ed! I'm out!!! Uninstalling",negative
As of launch there is no way to sort your feed chronologically and no way to show just people you follow on your feed. As a result of this your feed is nothing but celebrities posting psusdo self help positivity and major brands trying their hardest to make painfully unfunny posts to get clicks. At the present there aren't true ads but when your feed consists primarily of brands and corporations making constant posts with no way to get away from them it's kind of the same thing but worse.,negative
So many garbage accounts on here. I spend most of my day blocking & muting accounts that it is getting tiring.,negative
This is amazing 😍 App I wish you all public is participating this app it's App life Change ❣️ it's very crazy 🤣 app and friendship 💕,positive
This app was amazing but there's no messaging Option in there,positive
"app has bug on scroll, looks like its glitch or something on android",negative
Continue glitching screen overlaps previous feed,negative

No way to turn off auto play,negative
"Not worth downloading, I still think Twitter is better. This is too dull.",negative
it needs a bit more features.,positive
It's so optimized and user friendly,positive
Great Instagram texts based conversation app Really amazing 😍,positive
The app is glitching! Please fix this.,negative
"Initially seems to be great. But, its to early to comment on performance ( No of users & usage etc). Initial rating if 👍👍👍👍👍",positive
Great alternative to the musky blue bird.,positive
"So far so good, but still short on features. Off the top of my head, please add landscape mode for my docked tablet, hashtags, DMs, post editing... then we're good XD Looking forward to eventual fediverse server integration",positive
often crash or force close their own,negative
"Cannot scroll, app is a glitch",negative
"Amazing! Really nice to see that Twitter now has a big competitor and they need to buckle up. Elon thought Mark was coming physically to fight him, but Mark fought him from the product angle. Really nice branding/marketing strategy! I have downloaded and retained my Instagram username on Thread. Let's see where we go from here. I believe more updates will be rolled out soon.",positive
"When I downloaded it it just started to hang, making the pictures blur and breaking the pixels. It was soo bad experience for suree... I am just reinstalling it hoping that the issue is solved",negative
"I like it better than twitter, please, please, be the twitter killer.",positive
There is screen flickering issue in this app,negative
Very nice and function of zukarbarg families,positive
Early adopter and having fun on Threads. This is like when I just first used Facebook😂,positive
*** DO NOT INSTALL *** The amount of personal information that it collect is beyond words. You'll be tracked in more ways that you can possibly imagine. Go to a mastodon server you tust. Go see your family and friends in person but please don't became a victim of yet another Meta/Facebook tracker.,negative
crashes when trying to attache images in a quote,negative
Hello sir. Outstanding amount app thanks and please slove my account all problems.,positive
Needs optimisation but it's better than Twitter for sure,positive
Immediately after getting this Instagram deleted two of my three pinned posts and refuses to let me upload anything. It's acting like I haven't posted anything yet everyone else can see them. It's really weird and needs fixing or both apps are just useless,negative
Cannot open the app......check the glitch,negative
"It scams you, you cannot delete account, it steals away all of your data.",negative
"Had so much hope for it, but it's unusable. Crashed every time I tried to post and filled my feed with junk. Any feed from the people I followed became invisible instantly, swamped by random garbage I don't want to see. Uninstalled.",negative
Nice and cool Can you add dark mode to it,positive
Its only 1 day ago 5m downloading to 10m downloading Its too much fast running app downloading,positive
This is a pointless add on. Seriously just give it up that Twitter beat you at the thread game. People who use Instagram really do not care about threads af of they do they already use Twitter. The interface is also bland the vid posts look clunky with the text posts and the interface just makes the expernce a treasure hunt that you did not want to go on. Scroll across nope! Just down and down and oops missed a post up up up. Hey where did the feelng in my thumb go?,negative
"This app only made up Rich peoples, poor peoples phones not support this app. Full bug. Shame.",negative
Great app. Would have give 4 stars but gave 5 to get ratings up. Lol,positive
Making IG account the only option to get on this app isn't a good move.. 👎🏾👎🏾,negative
Lot of bugs evening post is overlapping,negative
"Launched wayy to early. Missing essential features, content is just Instagram without pictures. If it improves I might rate it higher but for now it's just too bare bones.",negative
Very simple and superb app😇,positive
Love the app but the thing I don't understand is why my ig account will get deleted if I delete the threads app🙄🤔😔.,negative

"Buggy when i try to follow people, but otherwise wonderful.",positive
Can't unfollow accounts and app closes out when I try to look at the comments Edit: still can't unfollow accounts,negative
I like the uncomplicated usage and ease of reposting the content with my people,positive
Photographer and journalism wants to inform peoples what is happining around the world,positive
Threads still needs improvement to competition with Twitter. Hashtag and DM should also be supported.,positive
Greatest app of all time feel like it gonna take over Twitter cheers to Mark Zuckerberg and his team for creating such a wonderful app🎉🎊,positive
This has potential but the app functions like it was designed by people who have never used social media. I lost count of how many features are missing. It's so limited for an app designed by a billion dollar tech company. It seems as though it was prematurely released to appease shareholders. It's very messy. I also don't like all the censoring taking place. Unless it's blatant hate speech no one should be censored. Let people discuss differing opinions and fix your app.,negative
I'm not able to add my professional account. Can we add multiple accounts like Instagram? If yes how?,negative
So far so good ! But sometimes it doesn't upload!,positive
Give the app 5 star best app ever love it very entertaining and real,positive
Excited to try this new app from Insta. Seems like Twitter initially. Will add more thoughts after using. I can't see any reviews yet so this could be the first reviews ever. 😛,positive

"Simply put, it's Twitter, but fun!",positive
In starting I'm so excited to use this but now its a waste of time app....,negative
"Sometimes I can't comment, it keeps telling me post failed to upload",negative

So far so good. Look forward to web version.,positive
"When I get started making an account here, it was crashing and lagging but my phone was perfectly fine no any issues or any other problems. I guess this app needs more enhancement and fix to the issues.",negative

"It doesn't have many people now, but I'm sure it will be great when people start to be active on it",positive

THE BEESSTTTT love this app! hoping for real great updates soon,positive
Please stop showing accounts that I don't follow. Why follow button exist if you only spammed threads from other accounts that I don't follow.,negative
"This app is not interesting nothing new same as Twitter , waste of time",negative
Meta garbage. Don't waste your time with this Fukkerberg trash. Massive waste of time.,negative
Very bad interface,negative
"This is just an all-encompassing Twitter imitation, with nothing new or innovative in it",negative
A good challenger to tweeter and easy to use,positive
App isn't working properly,negative
"I mean we just got here so I'm not expecting the world, however, seeing that we're going from Instagram straight to Threads, I'm disappointed to see that I can't seamlessly switch between my accounts on Threads like I can on Instagram.",positive

Not properly scroll ..... Display seens like glitch..,negative
Good user interface.,positive
"When I try to login with my Instagram, it is asking 8 digit authentication code but it is providing me 6 digit code. How can I login...",negative
Very clever marketing they give threads app options in Instagram that take you to playstore and open thread download. I just want to know that threads (meta) can takeover a job of Twitter?,positive
Glitches and unusable. I can't do anything with it.,negative
Not working and it's all a mess,negative
All in one best features,positive
"Very interesting , Clear and useful Apps 👏🏽",positive
Make it so we can log in without Instagram. I don't have nor do I want an Instagram account,negative
Has potential. But switching accounts is clunky,positive
It's amazing and surprisingly better than Twitter,positive
"Ahh yes, another app with too many permissions to take user information://",negative
Why do you need Instagram to sign on? Too many ads,negative
"Can't even message people on the app, rather twitter",negative
"i miss the ""trending topics"", a chat and i don't wanna see the activities from others that the people i follow are following",positive

Amazing app i feel the positive energy,positive
Little brother of Instagram 😂 But quite good.,negative

Great UI and UX .,positive
First time using it there still a lot of bugs,positive
It's great to follow the things that you already follow on Instagram today like your friends,positive
"Basically, Twitter without the problems.",positive

Awesome and smooth learning app,positive
Love it. But does it come in black (dark mode)? 😂,positive
Absolutely amazing...no need of Tweeter anymore...😂🤭,positive
Create your own Lists is Not a Feature. Only Following permitted makes this like Other New Social Platforms. It's Limiting & Not Convenient like Twitter for Grouping Numerous Topics & User Sources to review Easily. Meta obviously linked Threads Platform with Instagram quickly with little Value of Users regarding Lists. Is Follow Only better for Digital Data Capitalism? Hopefully it will Evolve. Does Threads have Follow Limit like Twtr for Users with Few Followers which having Lists increases?,negative
"Very promising, waiting for the updates",positive
This app is glitching can't do anything don't install it,negative
"i can't share threads to my story on Instagram or my feed, it loads but doesn't do anything",positive
Great app. Add trending topics section.,positive

"More typical lefturdwoketurdvaxxtarded censorship twatter wannabe app (that offers nothing new and far less capabilities) with FULL data mining and harvesting capabilities. This is an echochamber already.

Good app and when I use this 90 day then I know reality of this app so my give review the any problem,positive
Similar to tweeter but it's better more than that 💖💪🏽,positive
After a sec of looking around I finally understand the app. You write and thread and people comment and interact with them. You link your Instagram to the app and you have your account. Try it out!,positive

It's boring but cause everyone is on it I am on it.,negative
"First of all, this isn't a standalone service, it requires an Instagram account. Second, never forget that Facebook sold 86 million users data to Cambridge Analytica to manipulate the elections, and they're being sued in Europe for anti privacy practices.

"They can only delete threads profile if they delete Instagram account. You are not giving a fair choice to your customers, apparently. We are not even able to hide our badge on insta account.

Shady. Can't deactivate account without deactivating Instagram,negative
I will uninstall Threads because it's too much copy of Twitter I don't like it 😞,negative

This is the most amazing app in the world. I saw it on Facebook today,positive
Turn on the reels on threads to have a lot of fun,positive
App doesn't load no post,negative

Can't switch account like Instagram 😞,positive
Can't create an account. Utterly useless 😒,negative

This app is great. Hopefully twitter will die. Dont listen to the Elon review bombers. Musk is so terrified hes paying people to bot spam his competition.,positive
Great!!!! Amazing social media!,positive
Crashed. It can't be used.,negative
You guys should do account switching faster. Just like Twitter :),positive
My First impression is not that good! I can't log in. Threads wants me to wait a few minutes and try again for last half hour!!!! Are you kidding me?!,negative
"A poor version of Twitter. Meta should just give up at this point, the company sucks the last 5 years.",negative
Rip off of Twitter. Like Twitter but it steals all your data.,negative
"Erm, home feed full of accounts i don't follow?? Makes this app pointless in my opinion",negative
The error that is thrown in the UI is super annoying. The exact same thing happens to me every day. I didn't think this error would happen that often. Fix that problem.,negative
"Great app, easy to use.",positive
Nice Application for giving collision to Twitter 😃,positive
So why can't I see the number of people that I am following? Why am I being shown all of these pages that I do not follow?,negative

"Woah this app is I insane tho I wish I knew more about it. Anyways, I just downloaded it and so for so good",positive
It's so amazing app I love it. Thanks Meta,positive
"An unethical move by Zuck by copying the Twitter app. What is the purpose of ditto copy of an existing app? Just being personal or what? Technically this app ain't working perfectly, full of glitches, wha it should be as there was nothing new in it. What we achieved at Twitter with numbers of followers, do you think we will start from zero here? Absolutely not. Either change the app design, functionality and purpose of this app or take a screen shot of my review. This project gonna failed soon.",negative
Bad !!!! As hell. I will say that it can't delete the thread account... You have created instead it will delete your Instagram account too..! You can't delete them separately. You can't text anyone on threads. Wrist feature of thread is the deleting account. Mobs who are looking for thread do not install or create a account or it will ruin both of acc insta and threads's account. I regret getting thread. I think here I will disconnect with Instagram or threads.,negative
"Since this app is linked to Instagram, it's not possible to use a new user name, but the user name you have already setup on Instagram, which is pointless for a new app. I wanted to create a new user name, but it's not possible here sadly. Also, WAY too much privacy-invasive permissions requested by this app. Uninstalling right away.",negative
"Why do you have to link to Instagram .. you can brand it with IG, but why link followers from them here.. bad choice .. keep it independent like Twitter and let it grow organically",negative
"Can only login with Instagram account so they are impossible to untangle. Cannot access from desktop, app-only. Wants permission to record literally everything you do on your phone.",negative
It has lots of bugs,negative
They don't support freedom of speech if your view does not align with them you will get banned I wouldn't recommend using it,negative
Still facing glitches,negative
"There's a bug where even with fast connection it'll say ""post failed to upload"" or when i post something it'll automatically save in my phone ""which doubles it"" those bugs is soo tiring, as of the moment ngl twitter is better.",negative
Can't login without Instgram.,negative
Nice app work good some how 😊 better than Twitter I enjoyed this app🙂😊,positive
"Good but need 2 important changes, I do not want to see people that I am not following them in my threads. second, the fed should be in chronological order by the begging of the threads",positive

Allow login with something other than Instagram. It's mental poison.,negative
"This is very nice and clean app, naw this app my fevarite ❤️❤️❤️❤️",positive
"THE AMOUNT OF CENSORSHIP IS RIDICULOUS. I'm open to trying new apps and was genuinely curious about this one. However, it's like a Facebook-Jail / Twitter wannabe. The feed shows you mostly people who you DON'T follow. (Like political people that you don't care to hear about.) Threads suppresses free speech and violates your rights to express yourself. If you have an opposing opinion, you WILL be censored. Insane. Worthless useless app.",negative
"One of the wrost software, I have ever been used. After installing and use my Instagram profile & Facebook profile was hacked and compromised. Generally I requested all of you don't use this application. One more thing if you install it you can't withdraw from your Instagram account. One of the failure application of Meta.",negative
"This is very useful for me ☺️ thank you so much ....🙏☺️ ❤️Love from odisha ❤️(India,,🇮🇳)",positive
Great experience. Interesting every step.,positive
It's a copy from youtube and Twitter so I don't like it,negative
I hope there will be many good features in the future,positive
"Still allows hate speech, slurs, and targeted harassment with no actual moderation. Reports are met with ""we're too busy to review your report"" when slurs are at the top of Zuckerbergs own thread. Do better.",negative
"One, who is bored with Twitter, can join Thread for some new experiences!!!!!! Plus points with Threads is, it is a part of META, which is growing with rapid speed!!!! Since, Twitter is been an entity of Elon Musk now, it had lost its credibility as Elon can do anything for money!!!! Enjoy Threads!!!!",positive

Just another replicated version of Twitter and Instagram. Didn't find the app really exciting or anything new Plus seems the competition was only to prove who has fastest account holder which mera have achieved successfully offcourse by their marketing strategy through Instagram. Else won't recommend the app to anyone Just another TIME WASTING MACHINE which forces you to retain your account and cannot be deleted willingly. #privacyconcern,negative
"What about those of us who do not have, nor want an Instagram account? It would be nice if I had the option to create a log in specifically for this app. Fix this issue, and I'll be sold...possibly. Uninstalling at this point.",negative
"The app is nice and I really like it more than the other app that I installed. But, sometimes the home tab was lagging. But I hope you will add something that will make the app more trendy and fun. Thanks!",positive
Uninstalled due to being forced into having to make a Facebook account just to make Instagram account just to make a threads account.. stupid! Shouldn't need all that unnecessary rubbish! The app should be it's own separate thing.. not having to sign in by using another apps..,negative

Extremely bad app. Has been screen lag from last 3 days and tried many time to fix it by redownloading the app but still doesn't work. Extremely worst expreience.,negative
Since I've logged out and uninstalled this app I have tried to post on my Instagram account. I can't see certain photos or things I've just posted but my total number of posts are correct....I just can't see them. Could be a problem.,negative
Couldn't even explore the app because of this glitches. Even for a small touch it starts glitching. Couldn't rate more unless the bug is fixed.,negative
"the app is useless it cant save pics and the home button wont show the post of accounts you follow, only bunch of strangers... they need to work on their algorith and like there are so much to catch up on before launching this app.",negative
"No point using since I can't customise what I see on my feed. I don't want to see all the possible posts from the multi-verse, only from who I follow. I have zero interest in sports, don't follow anybody in sports, so that showing up is an instant uninstall.",negative
"Boring, wish i never downloaded it cause i can't delete my acc without deleting my IG, Facebook ( meta now ) as always never bring something new on the table since 2014, high expectations just tl find myself in a boring cheap version of Twitter ~ at least be a little creative with your apps and stop copying other apps to stay relevant ( Snapchat - TikTok - telegram - Twitter) and get us something new that may get our attention",negative
stop trying to use an algorithm to guess what content I want to see and just let me view posts from people I follow. Twitter is a nightmare and it still allows me to do this. it was bad when you did it to Instagram and it is still bad.,negative
I was super excited but you can't sign up for a new account you must use an Instagram account. It claims you only need an email but once you are done creating your account it immediately requires a phone number or it just freezes.,negative
Good potential but too buggy and not enough features to be useful. Will come back when they've had time to sort things out.,negative
I feel like this is just a copy of Twitter with nothing new or sepcial and it's even worse.. I literally downloaded it just because three of my favourite content creators are on it. You didn't even try to make new designs or buttons or features like what is this?,negative
"Once upon a time, this app had the swagger of a superstar, but now it's just begging for a standing ovation from the exit door. The hype train has derailed, leaving nothing but a ghost town of deserted users in its wake. If boredom had an official spokesperson, it would be this app. Time to bid adieu to the good ol' days and embrace the exciting world of apps🐦that actually deliver on their promises!",negative
"Well I downloaded the app only to find out afterwards that you have to have a Instagram account to log in, and there's no other way around that that I saw, so 1 star. If it's fixed, then I will re-review. I don't have Instagram and I'm not getting it either.",negative
Very easy to use. Can you add download button to image in every user threads? Because somehow we want to save the image they sent to us. Overall is great!,positive
"I'm failing to install this app on my phone despite it being compatible with my device. It downloads 98% but then crashes and I get the message ""cannot install threads "" 🤷🏾‍♂️",negative
Doesn't work as a stand alone platform. Wasn't interested in getting Instagram but to use this you must have an Instagram account and then if you don't like it you can't delete it without deleting your Instagram account too. No thanks.,negative
Why its connected with Instagram.. i installed it and open account from insta. Now this thread badge is shown up in insta's bio. I Removed it many times from there..but its again shown on page refresh. Please do this app independently from insta...or i uninstall both the app..🙂,negative
"Mine keeps crashing when I @, quote or add a photo, tried uninstalling reinstall restart phone..... Nothing on Google to say what the issue is. Phone works fine with all other Meta apps",negative
Dire. Installed and uninstalled because the flow of it isn't upto scratch. You get random posts in your feed. The data collection is very bad and intrusive,negative
I downloaded & found it requires an Instagram account so just another gateway to an app i dont want. Twitter at least was stand alone but its policy on needing a mobile number puts me off using it. So Ill just stick to meeting mates for a drink & having real conversations with out enriching billionaires further.,negative
Well i use Facebook the most and Instagram sometimes but they both have the same passwords and I was on this new app earlier and now it's saying my password is incorrect.. so I'll just stick with Facebook I guess. Wasn't a huge fan of Twitter or Instagram to begin with.,negative
This is just a simplified Facebook. Nothing else. No chronological order sorting and no way to filter only those who you follow. I'll just stick to Twitter until y'all decide to give users what you want.,negative
I was super excited to try Threads but i was super disappointed with it. My feed was just full of suggested post of people & things that didn't interest me & that i didn't follow. Hard to find the people i did follow. plus i can't search topic's. I'VE NOW DELETE APP. 😥,negative
Had to uninstall this app as my phone started acting up after installing and using the app for two days. My phone kept on ghost tapping and scrolling or other apps would hang.,negative
What the point of trying to be a replacement for twitter when the app doesn't allow you to only view posts from ppl you follow on your feed and doesn't allow any nsfw content. This is just an even more sanitized and advertiser friendly version of Instagram...,negative
"This is one of the worst apps in the list of worst apps I ever used, I don't wished to be here just got here cause a friend asked me to and now I can't delete my account neither can I use this app and it is collecting some useless data that a chatting and connecting app doesn't require, I do wish it gets banned in India",negative
Worst experience I was curious about the app but the moment I downloaded it I just regreted so bad the display was getting a glitch I don't know how it's hard to explain what was happening it was kind of crashing I never felt the app normal when I open the app it shows a glitch kind of a pattern of Matrix like appearence and it's so bad,negative
"This app froze first, then it got repaired, and afterwards, my Instagram is missing so many posts from feeds. I've reported multiple times, still no result.",negative
It very good alternative for Twitter. Need space feature and trending page. It great if you able to add shorts like feature.,positive
This is worst.. I downloaded for the first time(ofc) and it is showing a glitch and not working properly... I keep on refreshing it but it doesn't work and shows the same glitch over and over...,negative
